# Around Warsaw: project instructions

Around Warsaw (formerly Nocna Warszawa; bundle/package IDs keep `com.olshanskysoft.nocnawarszawa`,
build files keep `NocnaWarszawa`; the 87,3 radio station is KEBAB FM, id and folder `nocna_fm`).
A free, open-source (MIT) fan game: an isometric small-car arcade drive (and a helicopter) through
the real centre of Warsaw, Godot 4.7.2 (Mobile renderer, iOS first, Metal), from OpenStreetMap and
GUGiK open data. Next milestone: a high-quality central-Warsaw demo on the iPhone (docs/DEMO.md).
The repo is public.

## Where things are

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `game/` | Godot project: `scripts/`, `shaders/`, `tools/` (check scripts, `bake_city.gd`), `data/`, `map/` (baked), `audio/` |
| `tools/` | Python bakes and helpers, `verify.sh`, `shots.sh`, `device_run.sh`, `check_map_data.py`, `export_ios.sh`, `hooks/guard_godot.py` (blocks game runs without `--nosave` or a quit flag) |
| `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` | short INDEX. The full reference is `docs/archive/DEVELOPMENT-full.md` (~490 KB): never read it whole, grep a section and read that range |
| `docs/WORKFLOW.md` | the loop, owners, light/full definition of done, milestone gates |
| `docs/BACKLOG.md` (issues, decisions) · `docs/QUESTIONS.md` (parked questions, lanes in progress) · `docs/ROADMAP.md` (order of work) · `docs/DEMO.md` · `docs/LANDMARKS.md` · `docs/ADDONS.md` | read only the section you need |
| `.claude/agents`, `.claude/skills` | agents and skills (their descriptions say when to use them) |
| `data/raw/`, `build/`, `shots/`, `game_*/`, `refs/` | gitignored, never committed |
| `game/map/index.*`, `sectors/`, `proxies.scn`, `shared/`, `lod2.*`, `terrain.json` | derived, gitignored; a fresh clone runs `tools/setup_map.sh` once (`--full` for GUGiK data) |

## Model routing

The project default is **Sonnet**; the coordinator picks the model per thread. **Opus** only for
map geometry, gameplay design and feel, performance, device-gated work, root causes, and accepting
art. **Sonnet** for content, text, landing/site, docs, object polish and applying a spec.
**Haiku** for lookups, counts and log crunching. Agent files follow this (`gameplay-dev`,
`object-modeler`, `qa-tester` Sonnet; `map-engineer`, `perf-engineer`, `game-designer`,
`art-director` Opus; `scout`, `Explore` Haiku). A cheaper run that fails its gates or returns
open questions is re-run one tier up, not patched. Only the main session spawns agents. Delegate
file dumps, logs and shot sets; keep the summary. Say which model each delegation used.

## Backlog mode (standing rule)

The work never stops for a question: park it in `docs/QUESTIONS.md` with the default that was
built, and take the next item by priority (backlog-loop skill). One item per thread, one session
per area (driving, map, visuals, content, performance, landing, store); check open PRs, recent
main commits and "In progress" first. A cloud session merges its own PR once every check is green.
Irreversible things, paid tools, device runs and store submissions wait for the user's yes.

## Hard rules

- **Runs.** Every game run passes `--nosave` and quits (`--quit-after N` or `--shots=`); autopilot
  runs never quit by themselves; `check_steering.gd` needs `--fixed-fps 60`. Engine flags before
  `--`, game flags after. macOS has no `timeout` (`perl -e 'alarm shift; exec @ARGV' 600 cmd...`).
- **Both city paths** (runtime build and prebuilt sectors) must work. After a map change:
  `python3 -I tools/bake_sectors.py`, then `godot --path game --resolution 320x180 --script
  res://tools/bake_city.gd` with a renderer, never `--headless`. Check looks with `--prebuilt` too.
- **Derived map files are never committed.** After any centrum.json re-bake run the whole chain
  and `python3 -I tools/check_map_data.py`; new counts only on purpose, recorded in that script
  and the archive's "Map data" together.
- **Performance is a gate.** The phone's frame grows with draw calls, not triangles. Report bench
  before/after for anything per-frame or adding geometry, materials or lights (archive section
  "Performance budgets").
- **Downloads are pre-approved** (free dev tools, data, Godot add-ons from official sources): name
  each in the PR with source, size and licence. Add-on rules and the installed list: docs/ADDONS.md.
  A paid tool or service needs the user's yes. Never write the PixelLab key (or any key) into a
  file; no project `.mcp.json`; up to 50 PixelLab generations per loop.
- **Content.** Original art, music and writing. Real place names are fine; brands only as
  parodies; affectionate humour, never about real private people; on-screen text in Polish with
  English (warsaw-tone skill).
- **Device runs** only when the user said so for the current loop (device-run skill); never write
  a device identifier into a tracked file.
- **Public repo.** No secrets, keys, device identifiers, emails or absolute home paths in tracked files.

## Commands

```zsh
tools/verify.sh [--quick|--ios|--only=a,b]   # the verification set, one PASS/FAIL table
tools/shots.sh [--set=core|quick|names] [--size=2532x1170]   # phone-size screenshots
cd game && godot --path . --disable-vsync -- --bench --nosave  # bench
tools/export_ios.sh   # splits the map, prebuilds sectors, exports build/ios
tools/export_android.sh [--skip-city|--apk]   # the signed Play AAB
```

## Conventions

- GDScript: static types, tabs, `##` doc comments saying what and why. Python: `python3 -I`,
  standard library, a usage docstring. Checks are `game/tools/check_*.gd` printing `<name>: OK`
  and exiting 0/1; a new check joins `tools/verify.sh` in the same change. New test flags are
  parsed in `main.gd` and noted in the archive's flags table.
- **Docs bookkeeping: BACKLOG only** (fixed removed, found added). No ROADMAP row, no CHANGELOG
  line; the PR history is the changelog.
- **Definition of done** is light or full by change kind (docs/WORKFLOW.md): light for content,
  text, site, docs, polish; full (verify, shots, bench, `--ios`) for gameplay, geometry and
  anything per-frame. Name what only the phone can show.

## Git

Commit or push only when the user asks in the current conversation. Never force-push, rewrite
published history or delete a remote branch. Never commit `data/raw/`, `build/`, `shots/`,
`game_*/` copies, logs, keys, device identifiers or personal data. Subagents don't touch git
unless their brief says so.
