# Around Warsaw: development index

The full reference (every loop, every flag, the map-data chain; ~490 KB, 5,700 lines) was moved on
2026-10-31 to [`docs/archive/DEVELOPMENT-full.md`](archive/DEVELOPMENT-full.md) to stop agents reading it
whole. **Do not read it top to bottom.** Find a section below, then read only that range
(`Read` with `offset`/`limit`, or `grep -n "^## <name>" docs/archive/DEVELOPMENT-full.md`).
Earlier docs and code comments that cite `DEVELOPMENT.md "<section>"` mean that section of the archive.

## The few things to know without opening it

- **Run the game:** `cd game && godot --path . -- --nosave` plus a quit flag (`--quit-after N`, `--shots=`); flags are in the archive section "Test flags" (search `| \`--demo\``).
- **Release builds read no flags** (`game/scripts/release.gd`): only the debug export (Xcode Run, `device_run.sh`) and the editor binary take test flags; a TestFlight archive or the Play AAB ignores them (`check_credits`).
- **Verify:** `tools/verify.sh [--quick|--ios|--only=a,b]`; CI runs the no-map subset.
- **Performance budgets:** the phone's frame grows with draw calls, not triangles; the numbers are in the section "Performance budgets" (the 2 KB table is the gate for anything per-frame).
- **Map:** derived files are not committed; `tools/setup_map.sh` makes them; `python3 -I tools/check_map_data.py` after any re-bake ("Map data").
- **New behaviour or flag:** add a short note to the matching archive section (or a new one at the end), and a flag row to the flags table. Keep it brief; the PR is the changelog.
