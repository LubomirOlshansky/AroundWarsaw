# Kino Muranów (Generała Andersa 5)

Site key `kino_muranow` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_find_kino_muranow`, `_build_kino_muranow`).
Sources: F's four photos (2026-11-07, thread "Add arthouse cinema tour quest": a summer day with
the fountain in front, a spring day straight on, a summer night with the festoons, an autumn day
from the steps), kept in the project files `kino-muranow/photos/`, and seven Mapillary street
photos of the terrace and the arch (`refs/kino_muranow/street/`, CC BY-SA 4.0, gitignored). The
cinema is the quest stop of "Kino objazdowe" (docs/design/kino-tour.md).

## Identity

1. The red MURANÓW letters over the doors, a white KINO at each end of the front.
2. The cream one-storey pavilion with a grey plinth and poster boards under little lamps.
3. The terrace on its roof: a white balustrade and two tall pillars with dark ball finials.
4. The arch through the socialist-realist block behind, on the same axis as the fountain.
5. The round fountain with the green-bronze putti and the wide upper bowl on the square in front,
   and at night festoons of warm bulbs and paper lanterns over the café garden.

## Massing

- Pavilion: the OpenStreetMap `commercial` outline under the two `apartments` blocks (index 2018
  in centrum.json, 48 corners), merged with a straight 30 m x 14 m front (KM_FRONT, KM_DEEP) along
  the photo's straight facade; 4.8 m over the square (KM_H): the doors 3.0 m, the letters above.
- The blocks above stay the map's (14.2 m OSM / LoD2). The arch block: 10.4 m wide, 1.1 m proud of
  the block's front at v = -27.3 m, from the terrace to 15.4 m over the courtyard behind.
- The arch: radius 2.6 m, springing 6.2 m over the terrace.

## Facade

- Base: a grey plinth 0.9 m (photo 4), cream above it to a 0.35 m cornice slab proud 0.22 m.
- The front (u from the doors' middle along the street): glass doors u -2.4..2.4, 3.0 m, five
  dark frames and two transoms; poster boards u -8.6..-3.1 and 3.1..8.6 at 0.95-3.45 m, two
  parody posters each (shapes only, no real film), a little lamp on an arm over each poster.
- Words: MURANÓW 0.95 m tall in red pixel blocks, 13 m wide, centred at u 0.6, bottom 3.75 m;
  KINO 0.6 m in white at u -11.3 and 11.6.

## Roof

- The flat roof is the terrace (pale paving), the white balustrade 1.05 m along every edge that
  faces the square, with a coping.
- Two pillars at u -8.6 and 2.6 (KM_ARCH_U ± 5.6), v -19.5: a 0.96 m base, a 0.6 m shaft to 4.6 m,
  a cap, a neck and a dark octagonal ball (the Mapillary photos).
- The arch block: two piers, the round arch in six steps a side, a dark passage behind, a cornice
  at the top and a band over the arch.

## Colour and material

Walls #e7dcb6 (photos 2 and 4, calmed), cornice #efe7cc, plinth #8c8b86, terrace #bdb7aa,
balustrade and pillars #ece8dc, arch stone #d2c5a3, letters red (0.86, 0.13, 0.1), KINO
white, door glass #2e3539 in M_PAVILION (warm-lit at night), fountain bronze #6f9a84, water
#58798a. Everything M_STONE but the doors (M_PAVILION) and the letters, bulbs, lanterns and poster
lamps (M_LAMP: their colour by day, lit at night).

## Ground and night

- The fountain at (u -2.75, v 19) on the arch's axis: a 4.2 m stone basin with water, a pedestal,
  four putti round a column, the bowl at 4.1-4.3 m. Trees are kept 1.5 m clear of the basin. The
  steps to the square are the map's (OSM `steps`).
- The café garden by the left posters: five small tables with two folding chairs each.
- Night (photo 3): a festoon along the front's top between five hooks, festoons from it out to
  four posts and between the posts, six paper lanterns under the front festoon.

## Detail level and budget

L3 (the arthouse quest's finale). Budget 6000 triangles (check_sites.gd BUDGET). One site mesh in
the shared building material: no new draw call, material or light.
