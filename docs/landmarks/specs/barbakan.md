# Barbakan: spec

Site key `barbakan` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_find_barbakan`, `_build_barbakan`). Written
2026-11-02 in a cloud thread from the OpenStreetMap outline; no photo and no LoD2 here, so heights
and colours are estimates *(photo check)*. It replaces the earlier skin (colour on LoD2).

## 1. Identity

The Barbican of Warsaw, a brick outwork of 1548 before the Nowomiejska gate, burned in 1944, rebuilt
1952-1954. Landmark card kept ("Barbakan").

## 2. Massing

The mapped outline is a C of wall about 3.5 m thick, opening to the east, around 22 m north to south.
One closed prism, from 1.5 m under the lowest ground to 9.5 m over it *(photo check: real curtain
height)*. Four octagonal turrets (radius 2.6 m) stand on the wall's mid-line, 13 m high.

## 3. Facade, base to top

Brick `#ab5a42` in `M_GOTHIC` (buttresses and pointed lancets from the shader), a stone course
`#c4b69a` on the walk, then a crenellated parapet 1.5 m high (`_attic`, zero thickness).

## 4. Roof

Turrets: a corbel ring (+0.35 m) and a steep eight-sided cone `#6b4a3c`, 6.2 m high, with a small stone finial.
The curtain has no roof.

## 5. Colour and material

| Part | Colour | Material code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wall, turrets | #ab5a42 | M_GOTHIC |
| Walk, corbels, finials | #c4b69a | M_STONE |
| Cones | #6b4a3c | M_STONE |

## 6. Ground and night

Car collision follows the simplified outline. Card (kept): "Barbakan", PL "Ceglana brama dawnych murów
miejskich, odbudowana po wojnie."

## 7. Detail level and budget

L2, triangle budget 900. Shots: city, from the east (inside the C) and from the south-west.
