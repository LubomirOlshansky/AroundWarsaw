# Kościół Najświętszego Zbawiciela (Church of the Holiest Saviour): spec

Site key `zbawiciela` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_find_zbawiciela`, `_build_zbawiciela`).
Written 2026-11-01 in a cloud thread ("Marszałkowska street by street") from the OpenStreetMap
outlines in `centrum.json` (no photo, no LoD2 here). Shapes and every height below the towers
are estimates; the towers' 76 m is the mapped height. The Mac photo check is parked.

## 1. Identity

Neo-Renaissance basilica (Józef Dziekoński and Józef Piotrowski, 1901-1911) on the south side
of Plac Zbawiciela, its front to the north, to the square. Defining: a pale plaster body, two
tall towers with copper spires, a dome over the crossing, a porch with a pediment. Before this
the map had two round 76 m posts and one 34 m box.

## 2. Massing

Frame: origin (-417.6, 1612.3) (the front's middle), u east along the front, +v out of the
front to the north. The mapped outline (simplified 0.6 m) gives the nave (15.7 m wide), the
transept (37 m wide, v -22 to -36) and the apse (to v -51). Porch 15.8 x 6.2 m, 18 m to its
cornice. Towers at u +-9.25, v -9.4, 7.8 m square, behind the porch's corners. Dome at u -0.5,
v -29.

## 3. Facade, base to top

Plinth 1.5 m (outline grown 0.3 m); a windowed storey (monument shader) to 21 m; a cornice
21-22 m. Porch: stone base, three dark portals (the middle 3.4 x 7.5 m, the sides 2 x 5.5 m),
hoods over the sides, a cornice over the middle, four pilasters, an entablature at 16.6-17.6 m,
a round window (r 1.6 m) in the pediment, three steps. Towers: square shaft to 31 m, cornice
with four pinnacles, octagonal belfry (r 3.4 m) to 50 m, cornice.

## 4. Roof

- **Nave and transept**: copper hips from 22 m, ridges at 29.5 m (nave) and 27.5 m (transept).
- **Porch**: a pediment rising 4.4 m (to 22 m) in copper, a gilt cross to 25.4 m.
- **Towers**: copper spire 51-69 m, a gilt ball, a gilt cross to 76 m.
- **Dome**: a 16-sided windowed drum (r 6.9 m) 22-36 m, cornice to 38 m, copper dome to 46.3 m,
  a windowed lantern to 50.5 m, a cap to 54 m, a gilt cross to 58.5 m.
