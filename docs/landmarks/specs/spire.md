# Warsaw Spire: spec

Site key `spire` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (TOWERS row `spire` with its `with` points,
`_build_tower`, `_spire`, `_spire_spines`, `_spire_crown`, `_spire_columns`, `_spire_canopy`,
`_spire_wing`, `_spire_plaza`, `_spire_water`) and the moving parts in `game/scripts/spire_motion.gd`
(the crown's LED ticker, the plaza's jets; shaders `spire_ticker.gdshader`, `spire_jets.gdshader`).
Rebuilt 2026-11-06 from F's ten photos (IMG_7328 to 7337: the tower from the plaza, the street,
the night plaza, the aerial at dusk, the canopy from below, the steel columns, Spire B and C, the
pebble channel, a design render) and the OpenStreetMap plan, parts, pools and planters in
`centrum.json`. The first rebuild (2026-11-02, three photos) gave the flaring shaft, the fin and the
beak canopy; this pass replaces them.

## 1. Identity

The Warsaw Spire (Plac Europejski, 2016): a 180 m glass tower (220 m with its masts) between two
55 m crescents, Spire B (east) and Spire C (north-west), round a plaza of pools and trees. What
makes a passer-by say its name:

1. **The swelling shaft**: slim at the lobby, widest two thirds up, drawn in to the roof (IMG_7329, 7333).
2. **The saddle crown**: the glass runs past the roof, rising to points at the narrow ends.
3. **The brand's moving sign** on the crown: here an LED ticker with the parody SAMSONG adverts.
4. **The polished steel columns** in Λ pairs round the set-back lobby (IMG_7337).
5. **The mirrored canopy** over the entrance, a wide bow with upswept tips (IMG_7336, 7337).
6. **Spire B and C**: blue glass, a pale stone top storey, a thin white roof edge (IMG_7330, 7331).
7. **The plaza**: a big pool with a fountain and planted islands, two small pools, a pebble channel,
   honey locusts and slim swamp cypresses (IMG_7330, 7332, 7334).
8. **Night**: the spines lit up each narrow end, the ticker glowing, the jets lit.

## 2. Massing

World plan (x east, z south). The tower's mapped outline is its widest plan: x -2743..-2698,

## 5. Colour and material

| Part | Colour | Material code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shaft, crown outside | #5a8ecb | M_SKIN + S_MIRROR |
| Lobby | #2c4656 | M_PAVILION + 0.5 |
| Columns, legs, soffit, canopy | #c3ccd3, #d3dde4 top, #8e9aa3 under | M_GOLD + 0.5 (polished steel: sky streaks, no warm glow) |
| Canopy rim | #f0f3f4 | M_STONE |

| Trees | locust #8daa48, cypress #5f7f36, trunk #4a3f35 | M_STONE |
| Ticker, jets | shader | their own ShaderMaterial (one draw call each) |

## 6. Ground and night

The tower and wings stand on the lowest ground under their outline; the plaza pieces on the
ground under each. At night: the lobby, the wings' ground floors and the spines glow; the ticker
brightens past the bloom threshold; the jets glow cool blue.

## 7. Detail level and budget

L3. Mesh budget 6200 triangles (check_mesh_quality; 5763 built), up from 2700: 13 shaft rings of ~60 sides,
the crown screen and coping, ~36 columns, the canopy bow (two skins of 24 quads and a rim), the wings'
extra storey and eaves, the kerbs, islands, channel and 26 trees. No new building materials (+0
draw calls in the city mesh). The ticker and the jets are two small meshes with their own shaders:
+2 draw calls when in view, no per-frame script. Phone bench still to run.

## 9. Open

- Phone look and bench (the ticker's text size from the follow camera, the jets' bob).
- The real canopy's double curve is a three-band bow here; the crown's points follow the photos'
  silhouette, not drawings.
- The design render (IMG_7335) shows rectangular fountain basins and café umbrellas; the photos
  show the pools as built, which we follow.
