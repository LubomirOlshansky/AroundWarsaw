# Pasaż Wiecha's pavilions: spec

Site key `wiecha` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_find_wiecha`, `_build_wiecha`); the pasaż's
lamp masts and furniture in `game/scripts/first_scene.gd` (`PASAZ`, `PASAZ_MASTS`, ITEMS) and
`props.gd` `add_y_mast`. Written 2026-11-02 from the Mac photo report
`docs/landmarks/photo-reports/dt_pawilony.md` (three Commons photos of the pasaż, the 2025 GUGiK
orthophoto, F's Mac, refs/dt_pawilony/) and four OpenStreetMap outlines in `centrum.json`, found
by their vertex average (`WIECHA_AT`). Card: "Pasaż Wiecha".

## 1. Identity

The walkway behind the Eastern Wall's three stores, named after the writer Stefan Wiechecki
("Wiech"), lined with low shop pavilions under the 1960s slabs. What makes it read:

1. **Two-storey modernist pavilions**: a black and dark grey shop storey of glass under a dark
   fascia, a white upper band with one strip window round it, a flat roof.
2. **Tall white Y masts** on the pasaż's axis, about every 25 m: one pole splitting into two arms
   with long flat lamp blades.
3. **Light grey slabs underfoot**, café gardens under white parasols, planters, black bollards.

## 2. Massing

| Volume | Plan | Heights above ground |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shop storey | each outline (simplified at 0.4 m) | -0.4 to 3.8 m |
| Fascia | the outline grown 0.9 m | 3.8 to 4.2 m |
| Upper band | the outline | 4.2 to 7.2 m |
| Strip window | the outline grown 0.04 m | 4.9 to 6.1 m |
| Parapet | the outline, its top a ring 0.25 m wide | 7.2 to 7.55 m |
| Plant boxes | two 1.8 m squares near the roof's centre | 7.2 to 8.3 m |

The four outlines, north to south: the podium row under the slab behind Sawa (L-shaped, along
the slab's west and north faces), the block by tower75, the pavilion on the square by Chmielna
(OSM name withheld), the podium under the south slab by Aleje Jerozolimskie. OSM says 4.3-7.6 m;
the photos show two storeys, so all are 7.2 m. The zone is each outline grown 1 m. The strip in
front of Scena Relax stays in the theatre's LoD2 model (one mass with it in GUGiK's data).

## 3. Facade, base to top

- **Shop storey**: dark glass #2b3035 (M_PAVILION, lit warm at night) with thin frames #1b1d20
  every 2.2 m.
- **Fascia**: #1b1d20 face, its top and underside a little lighter.
- **Upper band**: white #e9e8e3 (M_STONE); the strip window #3b4753 (M_PAVILION + 0.5, cool at
  night) with frames every 1.5 m.

## 4. Roof

Flat, #8b8c89, a white parapet 0.35 m high, two plant boxes #a9aaa6.

## 5. Colour and material

| Part | Colour | Material code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shop glass | #2b3035 | M_PAVILION |
| Frames, fascia | #1b1d20 | M_STONE |
| Upper band, parapet | #e9e8e3 | M_STONE |
| Strip window | #3b4753 | M_PAVILION + 0.5 |
| Roof | #8b8c89 | M_STONE |
| Y masts | white #eeeeea, blades lit #fff4dc | actors' material, LIT_SIGN |

No new material: the landmarks' surface and the first-scene mesh (+0 draw calls).

## 6. Ground and night

The car stops at each outline. The pasaż's ground is the start box's grey slabs (ground.gdshader
START_BOX). The map's lamps on the pasaż (OSM) become Y masts (map_builder.gd skips them; their
light pools in lights.bin stay), plus three to close the gaps. At night the shop storeys glow
warm, the strip windows cool, the masts' blades lit.

## 7. Detail level and budget

L2, triangle budget 1800 (1522 measured on 2026-11-02, `check_mesh_quality.gd` BUDGET). The
masts and furniture are in first_scene.gd's one mesh (~90 triangles a mast).
