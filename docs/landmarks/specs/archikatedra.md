# Archikatedra św. Jana (St John's Archcathedral): spec

Site key `archikatedra` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_build_archikatedra`). Written 2026-11-01
in a cloud thread from the OpenStreetMap outline in `centrum.json` (no photo, no LoD2 detail
here). The nave and chancel stay the kept LoD2 mass in brick (`M_GOTHIC`); the model adds the
west front. Values marked *(photo check)* wait for the Mac's `refs/`.

## 1. Identity

Brick Gothic church of the Old Town (14th century, rebuilt after 1944). Defining:

1. **A stepped brick gable** over the front, narrowing in tiers with stone copings and pinnacles.
2. **A tall pointed window** in the middle of that gable.
3. **A pointed portal** in a small gabled porch.

## 2. Massing

Frame: origin (-741.3, -1633.0) (the front's west corner), u along the 27.6 m front (axis
(0.685, 0.729)), +v out of the front to the street (south-west). The outline's front is
buttressed: the wall sits at v about -0.4, the buttress tips at v about +1.0. Porch: u 9.2..18.4,
v -0.6..2.4, 8.5 m to the eave, a gable to 11.5 m. Gable screen: four tiers at v -0.25..1.35,
half-widths 12.8, 9.4, 6.0, 2.6 m up to 18.5 / 24 / 28 / 31 m, cross to 35 m *(photo check)*.

## 3. Facade

Stone plinth under the porch; brick walls with the Gothic shader's pointed lancets; the great
window (4.2 x 8 m, with a pointed head to 25.4 m) in the second tier; stone copings 0.45 m
thick on every tier.

## 4. Roof

Porch gable in dark roof tone; the nave roof stays LoD2's. Pinnacles (stone, pointed caps) on
the tier corners and the front's two buttresses; a stone cross on the top step.

na Starym Mieście.", EN "A Gothic brick church in the Old Town." Open *(photo check)*: the real
gable height and step count, the window's shape, whether the tower stands at the front.
