# Pałac Krasińskich: spec

Site key `krasinski` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_find_krasinski`, `_build_krasinski`). Written
2026-11-02 from the Mac's reference set (`refs/krasinski/`, 17 Wikimedia Commons photos, GUGiK
orthophoto, OSM way 34614532; REPORT.md there) and GUGiK LoD2 (eaves ~16.5 m, ridge ~21.5 m).

## 1. Identity

The Krasiński Palace (Tylman van Gameren, 1677-1683; the National Library's special collections),
the white baroque palace on Plac Krasińskich. What makes it read:

1. **A long white block under a mint-green copper hip roof** (OSM says grey: wrong), a stone
   balustrade with vases along the eaves.
2. **A central risalit on both fronts under a pediment full of relief**, a statue on its apex and
   on each foot.
3. **Four corner pavilions under their own pyramid roofs**, and on the street front the wings'
   round-arched loggias and the balcony porch over the main door.

## 2. Massing

axis to the SSE (0.5592, 0.8290), +v to the garden (WSW). The street front (ENE) is at v = -13.8.

## 3. Facade, base to top

Plinth (the union grown 0.15 m) to 0.9 m; ground floor; a string course at 5.0-5.35 m; the piano
nobile and the top floor in M_MONUMENT's window rhythm; the cornice. Street front: six round arches
(dark navy, 2.2 m) in each wing's loggia at 6.0-10.7 m and six on the ground floor; an arched
window over the door; the carved double door in a stone portal; four columns carrying a balcony
with a balustrade at 5.0 m; three steps. Garden front: the garden door under a small balcony,
seven arches in the wings' ground floor, three steps.

## 4. Roof

Copper hip over the block inside lead walkways (the cornice's top, #a0a7ac) along both eaves; a
pyramid on each corner pavilion; the pediments' roofs run back into it. Twelve dormers (six a long
slope) with dark louvres, eight white chimneys (1.1 m, to 21.6 m). Counted from photo 11 and the
ortho (ridge along the axis, transverse gables at the risalits).

## 5. Colour and material
