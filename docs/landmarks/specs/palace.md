# Pałac Kultury i Nauki: spec

Site key `palace` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_palace_frame`, `_build_palace`, `_dial`;
the plan constants `P_WINGS`, `P_BLOCKS`, `P_TIER`, `P_CORNERS`, `P_SHAFT`, `P_BAYS`,
`P_COURTS`, `P_HALL`). Written 2026-11-01 in a cloud thread from the OpenStreetMap parts in
`centrum.json` (the Palace is mapped in 3D: the base, the corner pavilions, the north and south
blocks, the entrance block, the Congress Hall, the tower's first tier with its corner towers,
the shaft, the clock tier, the lantern, the crown and the spire, all with heights) and the
earlier model. The reference photos in `refs/` live on the Mac and were not reachable from the
cloud. The Mac's side-by-side photo check (2026-11-01) is applied: no step at the terrace, a
cornice band on the shaft, the Congress Hall's flat stepped metal roof, a 25 m portico, the
spire's gold and its bronze foot. The stone's colour is parked in QUESTIONS.

## 1. Identity

Lev Rudnev's Palace of Culture and Science (1952-1955), the city's tallest building for half a
century and the first thing the opening flight shows. What makes a passer-by say its name:

1. **The stepped tower**: a wedding-cake profile, a wide first tier with four corner towers, a
   ribbed shaft, a narrow clock tier, an arcaded lantern, a crown and a long spire to 237 m.
2. **Pinnacles and attics on every step**: crenellated parapets in the Polish Renaissance
   manner on every roof edge, pinnacles on every corner.
3. **The ribbed shaft with heavy corner piers**: each face's middle bay set back between solid
   corner piers, stone ribs running up it.
4. **The clocks**: a lit dial on each face of the clock tier (Warsaw time).
5. **The low palace round it**: four-storey wings round two courtyards, corner pavilions, the
   Congress Hall's half-round end to the west, the columned entrance on the east.

## 2. Massing

The Palace's own frame (from the clock tier's square, `_palace_frame`): u towards Marszałkowska
(east-north-east), v towards Al. Jerozolimskie (south-south-east), metres from the clock tier's
centre. Heights over the ground under the outline.

| Volume | Plan (u, v) | Heights | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base | the mapped outline, 217 x 266 m, two courtyards | 0 to 18 m | OSM part h 18 |
| Courtyards | the relation's two inner rings | floor at 4 m | OSM inner rings |

| Spire | bronze foot 3.6 m (200.5-208 m), then 3.2 m to a point | 200.5 to 237 m | OSM part h 237, mh 200.5 |

## 3. Facade, base to top

- **Base, wings, blocks (0-30 m)**: M_MONUMENT (tall windows between piers) in sandstone, a
  crenellated attic on every top (1.2-1.6 m), small pinnacles on the pavilions' and the
  blocks' outer corners. The courtyards' walls slightly darker.
- **East entrance**: six columns 13.5 m high, 4.8 m apart, in front of the entrance (25 m
  wide, from the Mac photos; the column count is medium confidence), an entablature on them.
  The real portico is 17 m deep; the mapped base covers its depth, so only the front row is built.
- **Tier one (18-67 m)**: M_MONUMENT on the mapped plan; each corner tower carries a 2.2 m
  attic, corner pinnacles (only where they stand clear of the shaft) and a small stepped crown
  with a pinnacle.
- **Shaft (67-139 m)**: M_MONUMENT on the mapped plan, so the corner piers stand forward of
  each face's middle bay; five light stone ribs up each middle bay to 136 m, broken by a thin
  cornice band (121.5-123 m, 0.6 m proud) about five storeys under the top. On top a 3 m
  attic, a big pinnacle on each corner pier (14 m) and one smaller in the middle of each side.
  No step at the 30th-floor terrace (114 m): the Mac photos show one width up to the top cornice.
- **Clock tier (139-168 m)**: a 4 m stepped plinth with an attic, the tier with a 6.3 m dial
  on each face (gold rim, hour marks, the hands from the shader), an attic and four pinnacles.
- **Lantern (168-188 m)**: three tall dark arches on each face between stone piers, an attic.

## 4. Roof

Flat roofs (#8f877a) behind the attics everywhere; the courtyards' floors lighter. The Congress
Hall: a flat grey metal roof (#8d9398) in concentric steps, the roof at the wall top, a raised
16-sided drum 48 x 47 m over the auditorium (centre u -86, 22.5-26 m) with a flat top and a 4 m
vent cap to 27 m. The crown is a green patina pyramid (188-203 m) on the grey stone lantern;
the spire rises from a dark bronze foot (200.5-208 m) in gold (#d4a640) with two rings (214
and 225 m).

## 5. Colour and material

| Part | Colour | Material code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Walls | sandstone #d8c49c (courtyards 8 % darker) | M_MONUMENT |
| Attics, pinnacles, ribs, columns | light sandstone #e6d6b2 | M_ATTIC, M_STONE |
| Roofs | #8f877a; the Congress Hall's metal #8d9398 | M_STONE |
| Courtyard floors | #a39c90 | M_STONE |
| Hall roof drum | sides #8d9398 12 % darker, top 6 % lighter, vent 20 % darker | M_STONE |
| Lantern arches | #3a3640 | M_STONE |
| Crown | patina #9fbcae | M_STONE |
| Spire's foot | dark bronze #5a4630 | M_STONE |
| Spire and rings | gold #d4a640 | M_GOLD |
| Clock dials | #f4ecd6, rim gold, marks #26232a | M_DIAL, M_GOLD, M_STONE |

No new material, no draw call of its own: everything goes into the city's building surface.

## 6. Ground and night

The base stands on the lowest ground under its outline (walls from 0.4 m below); the car
collides with the base outline; Plac Defilad round it is the map's. At night the M_MONUMENT
windows light up, the dials glow and the Dusk look floodlights the stone gold (the dusk loop).
The opening flight starts over the tower (420 m up): the silhouette's heights are unchanged by
this pass. Card (kept): "Pałac Kultury i Nauki", PL "237 m razem z iglicą. Otwarty w 1955
roku.", EN "237 m with its spire. Opened in 1955."

## 7. Detail level and budget

L3 (the hero: the skyline, the opening flight, the landing's golden-hour shot), triangle budget
3900 (the existing `check_mesh_quality.gd` BUDGET; 3632 measured after this pass, 3202 before).
Mac bench (M4 Pro): no change against main (8.33 ms, 113 draws, 0.55 M tris).
Shots: `--solo=palace --solo-look=sil` and `flat` (the `first` set), then in the city at day,
night and the landing's golden hour.
