# Zamek Ostrogskich and the Chopin Institute (Tamka 41): spec

Site key `ostrogski` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_find_ostrogski`, `_build_ostrogski`).
Written 2026-11-01 in a cloud thread from the two OpenStreetMap outlines in `centrum.json`
("Zamek Ostrogskich" and "Narodowy Instytut Fryderyka Chopina"); no photo, no LoD2 here, so
heights and details are estimates. Values marked *(photo check)* wait for the Mac's `refs/`.

## 1. Identity

A 17th-century palace complex above the Vistula escarpment, rebuilt after 1945; today the
Fryderyk Chopin Museum has its modern interior inside it. Two blocks round a courtyard.

1. **Cream plaster walls** with a stone plinth and a cornice.
2. **Steep red-brown hipped roofs** with dormers, and cross gables on the castle's middle bays.
3. **A round corner turret** with a cone cap (castle block).
4. **The museum block's door** under a small columned porch on the courtyard side.

## 2. Massing

Castle block: outline centre (-70.3, -274.2), u (0.947, -0.321), 14 x 25 m (middle bays 1 m
proud on both long faces). Museum block: centre (-112.86, -268.13), u (-0.988, 0.156), 22 x 17 m.
Heights above the ground *(estimate)*: plinth 1.0 m; castle walls to 10.0 m, cornice to 10.6 m,
hip roof ridge 16.6 m, cross gables to 15.2 m, turret drum to 13.6 m with a cone to 21.0 m;
museum walls to 9.2 m, roof ridge 14.8 m, porch columns to 4.7 m.

## 3. Facade, base to top

- **Plinth**: 2 m stone band (1 m below ground).
- **Walls**: the mapped outline raised in plaster (M_MONUMENT draws the tall windows).
- **Cornice**: the outline grown 0.35 m, 0.6 m tall.
- **Porch** (museum, courtyard face): two round columns, a stylobate, an entablature, a small
  pediment, a dark glass door *(photo check: which door and face is the real entrance)*.

## 4. Roof

Castle: hip over 16.4 x 25.8 m rising 6.0 m, a cross gable on each middle bay (pediment face in
wall plaster, a dark window in it), 8 dormers, two chimneys. Museum: hip rising 5.0 m, 4
dormers, one chimney. The turret is on the north-west corner *(photo check: which corner, whether
there is one tower or several, and the real roof forms)*.
