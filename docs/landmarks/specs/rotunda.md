# Rotunda (Rotunda PKO): spec

Site key `rotunda` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_build_rotunda`, `_rot_crown`, `_rot_fin`,
`_rot_door`). Written 2026-11-01 from the Mac photo check of the start area (main ed7e873,
start spot `--at=-961.6,95.0 --heading=339.8`, the Rondo photos) and the mapped outline
`Rotunda PKO` in `centrum.json` (a 96-point circle, mean radius 17.1 m, centre about
(-793.7, 391.6)).

## 1. Identity

The round glass bank pavilion (1966, rebuilt 2017) on the corner of Marszałkowska and Aleje
Jerozolimskie, by Rondo Dmowskiego, the city's classic meeting point ("pod Rotundą"). What makes
a passer-by say "the Rotunda":

1. **A low glass drum**, green-grey glass floor to eave between close silver mullions.
2. **The folded-plate crown**: a brushed-silver roof of radial folds whose ends make a ring of
   downward teeth round the eave.
3. **A raised oculus** in the middle of the shallow cone, a metal kerb round a glazed top.
4. **The entrances**: a flat silver canopy over the main door on the south, a smaller one on the
   plaza side (north-west).

## 2. Massing

| Volume | Plan | Heights above ground |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plinth | the drum's 52-gon on the mapped radius (17.1 m, Ø 34.2 m: the photo check says 35-37 m; kept to the map, Widok Towers stands right against it) | -0.4 to 0.3 m |
| Glass drum | the same 52-gon, a mullion at every corner | 0.3 to 10.8 m |
| Overhang | out to the radius + 2.2 m (Ø 38.6 m) | soffit at 10.8 m |
| Crown | 48 folds from the edge to the oculus (radius 5.4 m, 10.8 m across) | ridges 12.3 m at the edge to 14.4 m at the oculus; valleys 10.8 to 14.0 m |
| Oculus kerb and glazed top | a 24-gon of radius 5.4 m | 13.9 to 15.3 m, the glass at 15.3 m |

## 3. Facade, base to top

- **Plinth**: a dark granite strip, 0.7 m.
- **Glass**: green-grey panes from the plinth to the eave (M_PAVILION param 0.75: plain panes,
  a silver transom 1.3-1.55 m under the eave, a little sky in the glass, lit warm at night).
- **Mullions**: 52 silver fins round the drum (about 2.07 m apart on the mapped radius), 0.18 m
  wide and 0.32 m proud, plinth to eave; one bay is centred on the south door.
- **Main entrance (south, towards Al. Jerozolimskie and Rondo Dmowskiego)**: three bays of dark
  glass doors to 3.2 m, a silver transom bar over them (the mid-height transom, only here), a
  flat silver canopy 8 m wide and 2 m deep at 4 m.
- **Plaza entrance (north-west)**: two door bays, a canopy 5 m by 1.5 m at 3.6 m.
- **Signs**: the bank's name as a parody, BANK POLSKA, white, on the glass either side of the
  south door (32° each side, at 5.2 m, letters about 0.9 m). The red and blue light in the glass
  and the old crown signs are gone.

## 4. Roof

A folded plate: 48 radial folds, each a ridge and a valley, facets alternating #d4d8db and
#b0b6bb. At the eave the valleys drop 1.5 m below the ridges, so the plates' ends read from the
street as a ring of downward triangular teeth (2.2 m wide at the eave, 1.5 m tall, white-silver
#e4e7e9) in front of a dark fascia set back 0.5 m. The cone rises gently to the oculus: a 1 m
metal kerb (#c3c8cc) round a flat glazed top (M_GLASS_ROOF, lit at night) crossed by three bars
each way (the 4 x 4 grid). Two flat triangular metal plates (5.2 m wide, 3.8 m tall) stand on the
edge at the north-east and the south-west.

## 5. Colour and material

| Part | Colour | Material code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Glass | #5e7f7a (shade #4d6f6b, lit #6f8f8a) | M_PAVILION + 0.75 |
| Mullions, kerb, canopies, oculus bars | #c3c8cc | M_STONE |
| Roof folds | #d4d8db / #b0b6bb | M_STONE |
| Teeth | #e4e7e9 | M_STONE |
| Fascia behind the teeth | #6d7378 | M_STONE |
| Soffit | #b9bec2 | M_STONE |
| Doors | #2e3a39 | M_STONE |
| Plinth | #55585c | M_STONE |
| Oculus glass | #8fb0ad | M_GLASS_ROOF |
| Triangular plates | #a9b0b5, back #8e959a | M_STONE |
| Signs | white (0.95, 0.97, 1.0) | neon atlas (LandmarkSigns) |

No new material: the city's building surface (+0 draw calls) and the landmark signs'
MultiMesh (+0).

## 6. Ground and night

The car stops at the drum (the 52-gon). At night the glass glows warm, nearly every pane, the
oculus glows, the names stay lit white. Context: Widok Towers right to the north-east is now a
green glass grid with white mullions (TOWERS `widok`: S_GRID, #5d8478) instead of a plain blue
box. Card unchanged.

## 7. Detail level and budget

L3, triangle budget 1380 (1144 measured on 2026-11-01, `check_mesh_quality.gd` BUDGET).
