# The Patelnia and the Rotunda's stair (sunken places): spec

Site key `sunken` in `game/scripts/landmarks.gd` (`_build_sunken`, `_sunk_edges`, `_sunk_treads`,
`_glass_barrel`, `_sunk_doorway`); the ground itself is `map_builder.gd` SUNKEN (`sunk_floor`,
`_load_sunken`). Written 2026-11-05 from F's aerial of the Patelnia (Google 3D, attached in the
Operation Unslop thread), F's game screenshots of the Rotunda's stair ("some walls") and the mapped
geometry in `centrum.json`: the plaza (`areas` k plaza), Metro Centrum's pavilions (`landmarks`
"Metro Centrum", `buildings` 4-4.5 m), the walls round them (`lines` k wall), the stairs (`steps`)
and the GUGiK terrain grid, whose own bottom there is 9.9-10.2 m against the street's 13.3-13.6 m.

## 1. Identity

The Patelnia is the sunken square at Metro Centrum's exit, between the Palace of Culture's lawns
and the Marszałkowska / Aleje Jerozolimskie corner. What makes it read:

1. **It lies low**: about 3.4 m under the street, walled on every side, railings along the top.
2. **Two glass barrels**: Metro Centrum's stairs down to the station under two ribbed vaults of
   smoky glass, open to the square, closed against the low row of shop pavilions behind them;
   between them the pharmacy's dark box.
3. **Stairs down**: from Marszałkowska at the north-east corner, and the wide, gentle steps in the
   south-west (Schody im. Kokota) up to the Palace's park.
4. **The mural** on the south wall (site `rondo`, unchanged; it now stands on the retaining wall).

The Rotunda's stair: north-west of Rotunda PKO, between two planters, a stair down to the
Rotunda's lower floor and the underpass, under a glazed doorway at its foot.

## 2. Massing

| Volume | Plan | Heights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Patelnia floor | the plaza and the pavilions' outline (SUNKEN ring, 36 points) | floor 10.0 m (absolute) |
| North-east stair | 3 m wide between its walls, 10 m long | from the street (grid at its top) down to 10.0 |
| Kokota stair | 4.5-5 m wide, 14.6 m long | from the street (~12.8) down to 10.0 |
| Rotunda stair | the wedge between the planters, 7.5 m wide at the top, 23 m long | 11 m of stair, 3.6 m down, then the landing |
| Retaining face | every ring edge that drops, in pieces up to 2 m | floor - 0.3 to the street + 0.12 |
| Coping | 0.3 m on top of the face, street side | street + 0.12 |
| Band | from the coping out to 3.0 m (1.6 m by the Rotunda) | the grid + 0.05 (a stair's + 0.15) |
| Railing | on the coping, 0.12 m out | top rail 0.07 m at 1.0-1.07 m, a post per piece |
| Barrel | over each pavilion outline, 15.6 x 8.0 m | half barrel r 3.85 m springing from 0.45 m, crown 4.3 m |
| Rotunda door | across the landing 2.5 m past the last step | glass 0-2.4 m, lintel to the street |

## 3. Facade, base to top

- **Retaining faces**: plain concrete, one quad per piece, from just under the floor to the coping;
  the street side shows a short face from the band up to the coping.
- **Railing**: dark steel, thin two-sided bands (a post every piece, a top rail).
- **Treads**: risers ~0.16 m across the stair's whole ring (the strip between two risers cut by the
  ring), each level with the strip's higher end; alternate treads a shade darker.
- **Barrels**: nine flat strips round the half circle, a steel rib every ~1.3 m (the mouth's
  heavier), the far end closed by a glass half-disc, the mouth open; concrete sills along both
  sides; inside a dark well and three lighter steps at the mouth (the stair going down).
- **Rotunda door**: dark glass in three steel mullions under a concrete lintel.

## 4. Roof

The barrels' glass (the cool pavilion glass, M_PAVILION + 0.5); nothing else has a roof. The site
stays out of the roof grid (`_no_roof`): no cassette or helicopter landing on a railing or a vault.

| Rotunda door | #33424d glass, #3b4046 mullions | M_GLASS_ROOF, M_STONE |

## 6. Ground and night

The ground is `map_builder.gd`'s: inside each ring terrain_height is the floor (the car, people,
props, plazas and paths follow it); the drawn ground is lowered over the ring grown by one
sub-cell's diagonal, in 1 m sub-cells (0.5 m by the Rotunda), so no sub-cell's slope shows inside
the walls; the band covers the trench that leaves outside. Wall lines lying on a ring are the
site's (`_build_barriers` leaves those pieces out). The car collides with every walled edge from
the floor to 1.6 m over the coping; the stair tops stay open. The metro canopies the bake puts on
the Patelnia's three `subway_entrance` points go (form "none"): the barrels are the entrances. At
night the barrels' glass reads blue under the night light like the tubes on the roundabout.

## 7. Detail level and budget

L2, triangle budget 5600 (4509 measured 2026-11-05 on the flat stub, `check_mesh_quality.gd`
BUDGET): an exception to the L2 range of 3000, because the site is a whole square and a second
stair: ~250 m of walled edge (~16 triangles per 2 m piece), four stairs of treads (~1200) and two
barrels (~700 each).
