# Biblioteka Uniwersytecka (BUW): log

Spec: [specs/buw.md](specs/buw.md). Site key `buw` (`landmarks.gd` `_find_buw`, `_buw_beds`,
`_build_buw`, `_buw_front`, `_buw_roof`).

## 2026-10-31: skin to model (cloud thread)

- Before: a skin (LoD2's massing in one green, `SKINS`), "no rooftop garden detail".
- After: L2 model from OpenStreetMap alone (no free photo, no network to Commons or GUGiK from
  the cloud): the glass block to the roof garden's mapped 10.9 m; on Dobra 12 copper plates
  with lines of text, the entrance under the middle two and the four philosophers on columns;
  a trellis post every 6 m on the other fronts; the roof garden from the 60 mapped lawns as
  beds on a pale deck (the paths between them); the long glass roof with its trusses, the
  second glass roof and the round lights as glass hips and cones (no flat top, so the cassette
  lands on the garden); three copper roof houses.
- Checks: `check_spec` OK; `check_mesh_quality` 0 defects, 1860 tris, budget 2250; the PR #115 cassette
  (`c01_buw`) placed on the garden (checked on that branch merged with this one).
- Scores: none yet (no photos in the cloud; art-director pass waits for the Mac).

## 2026-11-01: pass 2, the roof from the orthophoto (cloud, from the Mac's check)

- The Mac's first render lacked the roof parts: its index.json was split before this branch
  added the library to `bake_sectors.py` SITE_NAMES (fixed by the re-split; `_find_buw` now
  warns when the parts are missing).
- Redone from GUGiK's orthophoto, georeferenced on the game grid: the flat glass field and its
  tail along the Dobra side with the walkway, the flat second glass roof, the oculus in its
  ring path, the planted hump, the 6 m band round the edge (no parapet), six ventilators, the
  formal north garden with flowers and a plaza, the mound with the glass pyramid, white
  pavilions, the NW glass strip. Trusses and the steep pitches are gone; the flat glass stays
  out of the roof grid so the cassette still lands in the garden ((83, -982), checked with
  PR #115's code).
- `check_mesh_quality` 0 defects, 2144 tris, budget 2600.

## 2026-11-01: pass 3, LoD2's height and the south garden (cloud, from the Mac's re-check of main ba4a12d)

- The Mac's GUGiK LoD2: the deck is ~15 m over the 84.4 m base (64 % of the roof), the glass
  ridges 16-17 m, a lower 10 m part (6.5 %) the court in the south notch. The deck went from
  10.9 to 15 m and everything on the roof with it; the plates rise to 17.6 m.
- The mound is a solid dark green hill (22 x 34 m, to 18 m) with the teal glass pyramid on its
  flat top. The vents were missing: the old code looked for an edge that the outline's winding
  never gave; now the four mapped round parts on the north-east band are copper drums.
- The south garden: four 2.5 m paths split the lawns into beds of dark shrub, heather and lawn;
  five white pavilions, three by the glass tail; four small white domes on brown rings; the
  oculus's paved ring 4 m. The court (Collegium Iuridicum II) is part of the site: glass walls
  to 10 m, a green roof, a skylight. The walkway now runs from the field's west corner across
  to the pavilions, a second short one over the tail; the band over the notch is 3 m and
  greener, heather between it and the deck.
- `check_mesh_quality` 0 defects, 2431 tris, budget 2900. The cassette (PR #115's code)
  lands at (99, -958) on the hill by the pyramid, 18 m.

## Still differs / photo check on the Mac

- Which front the philosophers stand at (built on Dobra, before the copper pages; the
  orthophoto can't tell; the Mac check kept them).
- The south beds' plants are a hash of shrub, heather and lawn, not the real planting.
- The four mapped vents at the north corner stand outside the outline: the city's plain drums.
- The plates' count, width and how far they rise over the roof.
- The other fronts: how much is glass, how much trellis and greenery.
