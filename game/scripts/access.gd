## Accessibility and comfort options (loop v1.0 "Accessibility", 2026-11-01), the one place the
## game reads them: settings.gd keeps them in the file, main.gd calls `apply` after loading and
## after each change, and the rest of the game only reads the statics here. Settings → ŁATWOŚĆ
## (settings_panel.gd) is where the player changes them.
##   text_scale     1.0, or LARGE_TEXT: the HUD's text (hud.gd `_label`) one step bigger; read
##                  when the HUD is built, so a change shows after the next launch.
##   calm           true: no flashing or shaking: the patrol cars' lights burn steady instead of
##                  alternating, the VHS pulse and the headlight flash stay off, and anything
##                  that shakes the screen asks `shake()`, which is 0 then.
##   color_safe     true: markers that told green from amber or red from blue by hue alone get
##                  a second cue (the drop-off beacon turns blue, the patrol lights white/blue),
##                  and the HUD's win green and fail red (cards, the status panel and its 1ST
##                  badge, banners, notes, the target arrow, bubbles) pass through `tint`: the
##                  green turns blue and the red a lighter vermilion, a pair red-green colour
##                  blindness tells apart by hue and brightness.
##   vibration      false: `buzz` does nothing. THE hook for the phone's haptics: every
##                  Input.vibrate_handheld call goes through it, on to haptics.gd (the floor a
##                  hand feels, the iOS engine kept warm; car.gd's knock calls haptics.gd directly).
##   stop_assist    false: the quest stop assist (stop_assist.gd) leaves the car alone.
##   left_handed    true: the pedals, the horn and the helicopter's pads bottom left, the stick's
##                  half of the screen and Classic's steering strip on the right (hud.gd
##                  `set_left_handed`, applied by main.gd at once, no restart).
