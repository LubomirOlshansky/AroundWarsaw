## Beta values (2026-11-04): the way to a goal by road, as a polyline for the minimap's dotted
## route (hud.gd set_minimap_route), the one Podwózka's app draws. The kebab and słoiki deliveries,
## the way to the next kebab stand and the street races use it: the edge arrow alone points
## straight at the goal, through blocks and against one-way streets.
##
## The off-map links (LaneGraph portals) are left out: the edge roadworks close every road out, so
## the player can't drive them.
##
## The distances to the goal are worked out once (one LaneGraph.distances_to per goal); after
## that, every REFRESH s the line is walked again from the lane the car is on (a greedy walk
## down those distances, no new search), so it follows the car after a wrong turn.
