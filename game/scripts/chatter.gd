## The chatter budget (docs/GAMEPLAY_PLAN.md 0.2, F 2026-11-03: "when I'm driving and getting
## stuck, each second a few or more dialogs ... not every collision makes a comment"). About 25
## scripts speak through bubbles.gd and hud.toast, each with its own cooldown; this is the one
## budget they all go through, so the screen talks only when it has something to say.
##
## Every line has a class: QUEST (jobs, rides, rescues, rivals, the guide, easter eggs), POLICE,
## REACTION (someone reacting to the player: a driver's shout, a near miss, a dog walker at a horn,
## a cyclist in the bike lane) and AMBIENT (crowds, packs, bus stops, the city's chatter).
##
## - QUEST and POLICE always show; they still count as "a new bubble" for the rate cap and take
##   the room of an ambient or reaction bubble when two are up (bubbles.gd).
## - REACTION and AMBIENT: at most MAX_ON_SCREEN up, at least gap() s after the last new bubble,
##   none above MUTE_KMH (G16), none while the car struggles (pinned, pressing into something,
##   stalled, the stuck offer up) and for QUIET_AFTER s after.
## - REACTION: one in REACTION_WINDOW s; a reaction to a bump only for a hit of BUMP_MIN_KMH or
##   more; a near miss at most once in NEAR_MISS_GAP s.
## - AMBIENT also waits while a card (a job's, a ride's, the full map) is up.
## - Toasts (hud.gd ambient_toast): flavour toasts are dropped while quiet.
##
## The setting (Settings → ŚWIAT → Gadatliwość miasta, settings.gd `chatter`): Mało / Średnio
## (default) / Dużo picks the gap (GAPS). Pure state on its own clock: tools/check_chatter.gd
## drives it with tick() and no game.
