## Loop MW-3 (docs/design/vision.md 3.1-3.3, 3.2's Plac Zbawiciela, 4.5): the night and the river's
## people. Standing and sitting figures in the pedestrians' mesh and material (Models.person_mesh,
## actor.gdshader: the legs' swing off for the still ones, a lower, longer instance for a sitter;
## no new shader, no sun shadow):
##  - **the queues** at the clubs of vision 4.5's table (`CLUBS`, places.json ids): `max_len ×
##    hour curve × weekday`, rounded, rewritten every 20-40 s, in a line 0.7 m apart on the
##    footway nearest the place (no storefronts yet: MW-2), dark clothes, the bouncer at the head;
##    the door turns one away every 30-60 s while a queue of 4 or more is on screen (a `club_door`
##    `reject` bubble); the car at the door (< 10 km/h within 8 m) gets the bouncer's `car` line
##    once per club per night (the garage loop: painted black, the `car_black` line; at Lusterko's
##    door on a Friday or Saturday night, 23:00-06:00, egg E01 through `egg`, `door_egg`);
##  - **Level 26's roof crowd** on the tower's top at its place (vision's roof curve), when the
##    roof grid says the tower is there; F's asks (2026-10-30): the place's anchor moved onto the
##    tower (places.json `near`), the figures stand by the parapet of the roof grid's outline
##    (`roof_ring`: 48 rays round the top floors), a short queue waits at the
##    ground-floor door (`level_26_door`, a queue site with the `club_door` lines), and while the
##    club is open (the roof curve's hours) and near, a violet band of light rings the top floor
##    (one mesh in Models.material(), LIT_SIGN: +1 draw call, hidden by day and far);
##  - **the observation decks** (F, 2026-11-01): visitors on the Varso Tower's roof deck (the
##    tallest in the EU, 230 m; a ring of figures at the crown's parapet, from the roof grid like
##    Level 26) and on St Anne's bell tower terrace (the gallery round the octagon, 25 m up, the
##    model's balustrade): open 10-22 and 10-19, the afternoon and evening busier, weekends,
##    summer and dry weather fuller (`deck_level`); standing, facing out over the city;
##  - **Marszałkowska's tram platforms** (F, 2026-11-01): people waiting on every mapped platform
##    beside the street (`stop` sites, `stop_level`: the commute curve 7-9 and 15-18, thin on a
##    weekend, fuller in rain), standing figures in the same MultiMeshes;
##  - **the dawn crowd** (Sat/Sun 05:00-09:00, Live or the Dawn look): 20-40 walkers in twos and
##    threes on footway routes from Lusterko, Smoła and Jasna 0 to the Palm, Metro Nowy
##    Świat-Uniwersytet, the nearest tram platforms and two kebab stands (A* over the footways
##    and crossings, in a worker thread once); a `dawn_crowd` bubble once per 25 s in view;
##  - **the steps crowd** by Kopernik (vision 3.3): max 80 × hour × month × rain, groups of 2-6 in
##    rows facing the river (sitters, standers at the water's edge), the guitarist (egg E15);
##    without Live the season is summer (vision Open Question 5);
##  - **Plac Zbawiciela's summer crowd** (up to 40 standing in groups, Fri/Sat 21:00-02:00);
##  - loop MW-4 (vision 3.4): **the trend queues** at the three Wiralek slots and Lukrownia
##    (`TRENDS`): their length and the line's tag come from `trend` (city_life.gd's cycle and Fat
##    Thursday), bright clothes, no bouncer, a `viral` line now and then;
##  - **the police by the clubs** (Fri/Sat 00:00-08:00, Lusterko and Smoła): a parked patrol car
##    (police.gd `club_park`, the existing police units, never a chase) and an officer standing by
##    it (`police_club` lines).
## Drawing: one MultiMesh per 512 m sector cell for every still figure in it, rewritten only when a
## crowd in it changes, its AABB the figures' box (so a cell out of view costs nothing), hidden
## while empty; the dawn walkers one more MultiMesh, moved at 10 Hz while near the view. Crowds
