## Camera loop: the follow camera's laws, shared by the game (main.gd) and the replay test
## (tools/check_steering.gd), so the test measures the camera the player sees. main.gd keeps the
## camera's yaw (cam_yaw) and centre (cam_focus); this keeps what moves them smoothly: the turn
## rate, the look-ahead, the dead zone and the speed zoom.
##
## - Turning: the camera turns towards the vehicle's heading at a rate set by the error (a gain
##   per second), the rate itself easing in and out (critically damped: no overshoot), never
##   faster than MAX_TURN (Nesky's comfort limit, docs/DEMO.md 1.1). Classic turns with the car;
##   Point and the helicopter hold still while the finger (or a key) is down and HOLD_DELAY after
##   it lifts, then come round, easing in over RETURN_EASE: a held direction must not turn with the
##   view (loop 2a's steering fix, tools/check_steering.gd). Standing still it holds still;
##   heading wiggles under YAW_DEAD don't turn it.
## - Look-ahead: the view's centre leads the car along the way it goes (Classic: along the
##   camera's forward, which keeps the car still on screen while the camera turns) by LEAD_TIME of its speed
##   (more at speed: LEAD_TIME_FAST more at top speed), at most LEAD_MAX of the view, turning and
##   growing smoothly (LEAD_TAU) and never faster than LEAD_RATE of the view a second (the car
##   drifts across the screen at most that fast when the way it goes turns); braking, it shrinks
##   by at most LEAD_KEEP of the car's own speed, so the view never slides back past the car: it
##   glides to rest ahead of it, and stays there while the car stands (it moves again when the
##   car does).
## - Dead zone: the centre follows a window DEAD_ZONE of the view wide (on screen), so wiggles
##   inside it don't move the view (FOCUS_RATE then smooths it, as in loop 2a).
## - Speed zoom: the view widens by SPEED_ZOOM at top speed, out at ZOOM_OUT_RATE and back in
##   more slowly (ZOOM_IN_RATE), so braking doesn't snap the view in; the zoom's own changes (−,
##   +, a pinch) follow at ZOOM_OUT_RATE both ways. The shadow's sphere doesn't change with the
##   speed zoom (main.gd _camera_far).
## Before the camera loop the turn was a first-order lerp (up to 108°/s in Classic, 135°/s from
## the helicopter 0.6 s after a release), the lead shrank with the speed (the view slid back
## ~50 px after a hard stop) and the speed zoom came back in at once.

## The default view height in metres while driving (was 110 before loop 2a): the car is
