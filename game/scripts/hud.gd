## Loop 2e: the whole HUD is sized in points (screen_points.gd: 3 px a point on the iPhones the
## game targets; on a computer the window stands in for a phone), every control at least 44 pt,
## every text on one type scale (T_*: body 13 pt and up, labels 11 pt), everything inside the
## safe area (the Dynamic Island or notch, the rounded corners, the home indicator). The first
## screen is thin: the gear (settings) top left with the speed beside it, one context button
## in the middle of the top row (a rescue call that came in), RADIO and HELI / AUTO top right;
## the minimap and the wallet under the gear; the pedals bottom right; the credit line bottom
## centre. Time of day, rain, VHS, the picture style and the camera moved into Settings
## (settings_panel.gd); zoom is a pinch, and with the fixed camera a two-finger twist turns the
## view. The panels that come and go (the status, the call or job card, FLASH LIGHTS, the race
## banner, toasts, the performance overlay, the note and landmark cards, the radio ticker) are
## placed by `_layout` in that order of priority, each giving way along its column so none
## covers another or a fixed control; the speech bubbles (bubbles.gd) keep clear of all of them
## (`panel_rects`). `game/tools/check_hud.gd` checks the sizes, the safe area and the overlaps.
##
## Before: a floating stick on the left (point-to-steer), BRAKE on the right (climb and sink
## pads in the helicopter), the rescue card and status (shared with races and the side jobs),
## an arrow to the target, the race challenge and countdown banner, rival dots, side-job places
## and the target on the minimap, the wallet (złoty and respect), the note card (an easter
## egg), the landmark card (v0.8), the now-playing ticker, the performance overlay (v0.9, a
## three-finger tap or P). Loop 2a: the gear and the settings panel; the controls follow the
## scheme: Point and Fixed keep the stick and BRAKE, Classic has a left / right steering strip
## and GAS with BRAKE beside it (a thumb can slide between them).
