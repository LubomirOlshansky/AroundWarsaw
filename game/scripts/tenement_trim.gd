## Dobra and Tamka's tenements (Powiśle street by street, 2026-11-02): what a plain LoD2 wall
## lacks between its window grid and the sky. On a pre-war tenement's wall (R4 type 1) this adds
## a stepped cornice along the top edge, and along the bottom edge a string course at the first
## floor and, on a wall that faces the street, a run of shop-glass bays under a fascia board. Pure
## geometry into the walls' own tile meshes (the same material: no draw call is added, no
## collision, no roof-grid cell). Load time only, shared by both city paths; every seed comes
## from a place, never an index (check_streaming's identity). Spec docs/landmarks/specs/dobra_tamka.md.

## Appends one wall triangle's trim to `out` ("pos", "nrm", "col" as plain Arrays). The triangle is
## `a`, `b`, `c`, its wall faces `n` (horizontal, unit), `plaster` is its house's colour and
## `street` whether the wall faces a street close by. A triangle takes the cornice on a horizontal top
## edge (the third corner under it), the string course and shop front on a bottom edge (the third
## corner 3 m or more over it; the foot may follow a slope).
