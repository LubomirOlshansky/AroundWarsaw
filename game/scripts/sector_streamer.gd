extends Node
## Loop 3c: the city in 512 m sectors, streamed round the camera (docs/DEMO.md 2.4).
##
## The map node (map_builder.gd) is the global index: heights, decks, tunnels, the water test,
## the roof and picking grids, the kerbs the car feels, the game's data (prebuilt: loaded from
## map/index.res; runtime: set up from map/index.json). Under it, `Sectors` holds the sectors
## in full detail and `Proxies` one low-detail mesh per sector (sector_proxies.gd).
##
## Which sectors are in full detail: the 3 x 3 round the focus's sector (the car's physics
## needs its colliders), the next row once the focus comes within 192 m of its sector's edge,
## and every sector the camera's view needs: its box, from its lowest ground to its tallest
## roof and grown by 128 m, meets the camera's frustum (a tower two sectors off can stand in
## the view). A sector goes again once it is 256 m past that reach (hysteresis) and out of
## the view grown by 256 m.
##
## Loading never stalls the frame: one sector at a time, a worker thread loads and instantiates
## its scene (prebuilt: map/sectors/s_<i>_<j>.scn) or builds it from its file (the runtime,
## editor path: map/sectors/<i>_<j>.json, map_builder.gd build_sector). The main thread then
## adds its nodes a few a frame under a hidden root, spending at most BUDGET_USEC; the root
## shows (and the proxy hides) once every node is in. A sector the car stands in that isn't
## in yet (a jump: a tow, a race start) loads at once.
##
## Loop 3d-2b: the look-ahead wants the sectors the focus will need LOOK_AHEAD seconds on (its
## square and the view moved along its velocity), a sector in the view first; a prebuilt sector's
## pieces (its meshes, MultiMeshes and collider patches, one file each) load one a frame on the
## worker, so no frame takes a whole sector's GPU buffers and physics shapes (the one slow frame
## per load); each sector brings its slices of the AO, lamp-light and surface maps into a slot of
## city_maps.gd's arrays (at most CityMaps.SLOTS sectors in full detail at once).
##
## The loading fix (2026-10-31; docs/DEVELOPMENT.md "The loading fix"): the proxies the player saw
## close up came from the camera's look at a new target (a rescue or a delivery: the camera flies
## 0.6-3 km off and back) and from jumps (a tow, a race start). Now the view is tested wherever it
## reaches (its frustum cut to the map's heights as a rectangle on the map, not 1,800 m round the
## focus); the order of loads is the sectors in the view now (nearest the view's centre first),
## then those a coming view needs (`expect_shot`: main.gd holds the look until they are in, at
## most 1.5 s), then the rest by the look-ahead; a worker busy with a later class gives its sector
## up for one in the view; for a few frames after a jump the sectors whose ground is in the view
## load at once with the car's; under the title screen a sector's pieces load all at once
## (`hurry`), and the title offers "tap to drive" once the start's sectors are in.
##
## --sectors=all loads every sector at the start and keeps them (the old behaviour, pixel
## diffs); --stream-log prints every load and unload with its frame and main-thread ms, and (loop
## G0+) each worker load: its load and instantiate ms and the slowest frame while it ran, split
## into the frame's phases (process after the streamer, draw, to the next physics frame, physics).
