## Loop 3b: the player's car seen through the ground while it drives inside a tunnel. The
## ground over a tunnel stays drawn (docs/DEMO.md 4.4); the car shows as a warm silhouette
## through it: copies of its meshes with one unshaded material that ignores depth, drawn
## after the post pass, shown only while map_builder.gd `in_tunnel` says the car is down in a
## tunnel (one extra draw call per mesh then, none otherwise).
