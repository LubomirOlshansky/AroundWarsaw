## The game's language (2026-11-02, F: "Polish or English, not two simultaneously"). The game
## used to show every text in Polish with its English under it or beside it; now the player
## picks ONE language, on the title screen or in Settings → DŹWIĘK → JĘZYK · Language, and every
## screen shows only that one. Text is still written as a pair (Polish, English): the HUD's
## entry points (hud.gd `toast`, `show_card`, `ticker`, ...) and the other text widgets call
## `pair` / `pick`, so the secondary label is simply never filled. A text with no English
## (a street, a place, a parody name, a song) shows as it is in both languages.
##   code      "pl" or "en": settings.gd keeps the choice (`lang`, "" until the player makes one,
##             then the phone's language decides: Polish phones get Polish, every other English).
##   pair      (pl, en) -> [shown, ""]: the second slot is always empty, so a caller that fills a
##             "gloss" label with it hides that label.
##   pick      (pl, en) -> the shown one, for a single label.
##   split     "POLSKI · ENGLISH" or "Polski\nEnglish" (older inline pairs) -> the shown half.
