## Loop MW-4 (docs/design/vision.md 3.4, 3.7, 4.7 and section 5's MW-4 row): everyday life and
## trends.
##  - **Dog walkers** (06:30-09:00, 19:00-22:30; twice as many round Plac Zbawiciela and in
##    Powiśle): a walker (a pedestrian guest) on a footway with a dog on the lead ahead, three
##    dogs (long and low, squat and flat-faced, big and fluffy); the dog stops at the trees by the
##    footway for 3-6 s while the walker waits. A horn within 15 m (the player has none yet: the AI
##    cars' horns, traffic.gd's held-up and bumped drivers) makes the dog bark (three sizes) and
##    the walker say a `dog_walkers` `horn` line, at most once a minute. The influencer dog at Plac
##    Zbawiciela with three photographers (E27), the ball on the Kopernik roof (E16).
##  - **Cyclists** on the cycle paths (06:00-22:00, more at the rush hours): commuters, Rowerilo's
##    cream bikes with a grey basket, cargo bikes with a child; a row of parked Rowerilo bikes at
##    the dock (`rowerilo_dock`). A car parked on a cycle path for 3 s gets a bell and a `cyclists`
##    `lane` line (once per 45 s). A Rowerilo rider followed 400 m: E28.
##  - **Runners**: singles on the boulevards and in the parks (06-08, 18-21); KOLKA on Wednesdays
##    at 19:00 from Centrum Nauki Kopernik to Most Poniatowskiego and back (12-20 in pale yellow,
##    mint and white, a footway A* route); the Zając (the car beside the club, 9-14 km/h, 600 m:
##    the `runners` `zajac` cheer, E29's +40 respect once).
##  - **Hyrax** on Saturdays 09-17 on the stadium's forecourt: a cordon of barriers, a loop of
##    runners, a HYRAX banner, E30 (a lap); Podwózka's `hurry` riders go there that morning.
##  - **The Wiralek trend cycle**: three slots (Plac Zbawiciela, Chmielna, Tamka), a trend each
##    for 7 days and a WKRÓTCE day (`slot_state`); the queue (crowds.gd's `trend` sites) by the day;
##    a fascia per slot in the pixel font; E18, E19. Fat Thursday at Lukrownia (Live or --date):
##    a queue of 60 from 06:00 to 18:00 (E20 is egg_book's `pass` with the `lukrownia` crowd).
## Drawing: the walkers, runners, Kolka, the Hyrax loop and the photographers are pedestrians.gd's
## guests (+0 draw calls); the dogs, the cordon's barriers and the ball one city MultiMesh of a
## four-shape family (+1 in view); the riders and the parked bikes one more (+1: there is no
## rider MultiMesh to share yet); loop MW-2's Pędzik couriers (parodies.md 4: 4 by day, 6 at
## night, on the cycle paths and the footways, magenta, the square backpack) one more of their own
## (+1 in view: not in the bike family's four); loop couriers (parodies.md 4.2): 3 more by day, 5 at
## night ride the roads' kerb edge (the lane graph's outer lane, KERB_IN in from the kerb), 1 or 2
## couriers wait by each kebab stand near the view at night (the rider mesh's standing shape, their
## bikes parked beside them; courier_race.gd's challenger is one of them), and within 4 m of the car's
## path a rider swerves onto the footway or, with no room, hops; all in the same MultiMesh (+0); the fascias and the banner a
## mesh each, near them. No sun shadow. The logic ticks at 2 Hz; the movers step at 15 Hz
## (walkers, runners and far riders at 7.5 Hz) only while something is near the view; far from
## all of it nothing but the tick runs. The rules are static functions (check_city_life.gd runs them on synthetic clocks and dates).
