## Roadworks at the map's edge (2026-11-02, F's ask "roadworks at the ends of the city"): every
## road that leaves the playable map is closed a little inside the outline by believable Warsaw
## roadworks, so a street no longer just runs into the invisible edge wall. Each closure is a line
## of red and white barriers across the road (its amber lamps blink at dusk and at night, with a
## halo each), a B-1 "no entry" disc, cones in front; on the bigger streets a yellow ROBOTY DROGOWE
## board and an OBJAZD → detour board, the A-14 roadworks triangle 18 m ahead, and behind the
## barriers the works themselves: a dug trench, a sand heap, a corrugated pipe, a small excavator
## (on the widest roads a site cabin or a TOJ TOJ, our parody of the blue portable toilet) and a
## 2 m site fence with a tarp that hides the road running on past the edge (map_edge.gd). Service
## roads get a short line of barriers and a cone.
##
## The barrier line stands CLOSE_IN m inside the outline, so it is the barriers the car meets, not
## the invisible wall 5 m in (map_builder.gd `_add_edge_walls`): one box collider per closure on its
## own static body. The traffic stops at the same line (lane_graph.gd `e_shut` and `e_open`).
##
## Cost: everything is one mesh per CHUNK square in the models' material (models.gd, actor.gdshader)
## plus one MultiMesh of halos per square (night only), so a map edge in view adds 1-2 draw calls
## (+ the shadow pass) and the middle of the city nothing. Built in map_builder.setup_streamed (both
## city paths) from the index's roads; `closures` is the same placement for the check
## (game/tools/check_edge_roadworks.gd).
##
## The boards speak the player's language (lang.gd, 2026-11-02): ROBOTY DROGOWE / OBJAZD → in
## Polish, ROAD WORKS / DETOUR → in English (the British board's words, as wide as the Polish so
## the board keeps its size). The text is in the meshes, so a language change in Settings builds
## the roadworks again (`rebuild`).
##
## The prebuilt city (2026-11-05): the bake never yields to the worker thread, so map/index.res holds
## the colliders alone and the phone had invisible barriers. The streamer calls `rebuild` on opening
## it; the boards need the player's language anyway, which a bake can't know.
