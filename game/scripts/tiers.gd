## Loop G1: the quality levels, the level Auto picks for a device, and the pixel image's size
## (docs/design/graphics.md section 4). Static, so tools/check_tiers.gd tests the same tables
## and rules the game uses (main.gd applies them).
##
## - Auto (the default since G1) picks a level from the device's model id
##   (`OS.get_model_name()`, e.g. `iPhone12,1`; the number before the comma is the family, not
##   the marketing name: `iPhone11,x` is the XS/XR, the iPhone 11 is `iPhone12,1`).
## - The pixel image: each style has its lines (Sharp 480); the image scales up by the most
##   whole screen pixels that keep at least that many lines (at least 1), `step` coarser for
##   Low and Medium, then coarser again until the image fits the level's **budget** in
##   megapixels. The iPhone 11's 828 lines at Sharp were 1 → 1792×828, 1.48 MP, the most pixels
##   of any phone with half the Pro Max's GPU, and its High stuttered (1 % low 25 fps) from fill;
##   High's budget (the Pro Max's own 1434×660, 0.95 MP, the most a phone has held 60 fps with
##   at High) gives it 2 → 896×414 with High's shadows and effects, and leaves every phone
##   that already scaled by 2 or more as it was.
## - Loop G1b: **Auto starts sharp.** Where a level's budget makes the image coarser than the
##   style's own scale (budget_binds: High with Sharp on the iPhone 11 and the SE 2 / 3), Auto
##   draws the style's own scale with that level's effects (High ×1, not Ultra's extras), and
##   falls back to the budget for the next launches when a session there struggled (the
##   governor's GPU extras down a minute, governor.gd `struggle`), coming back after calm
##   sessions with a doubling wait (SHARP_*). Manual levels keep G1's rule.

## 2 km; Ultra's 4096 halves the texels again, 0.37 → 0.18 m); glow at night; rain streaks;

## Auto) is High plus the 4096 map and 16 reflection steps, with a budget that keeps a
## 1.48 MP ×1 image (the iPhone 11's look before G1, for anyone who picks it).
