## The night-buses loop (2026-10-31; docs/design/vision.md 3.5 "Buses", eggs E23-E25): the city
## buses at night and by day, on the traffic's own buses (traffic.gd's BUS pool of 8).
##
## - **The N sign**: 22:30-05:00 by the game clock (time_of_day.gd `local_clock`) every traffic
##   bus shows an amber N route sign (traffic.gd `night_sign`: the BUS MultiMesh swaps its mesh
##   for the bus with the sign: +0 draw calls, no shader change).
## - **The night hub at Dworzec Centralny**: every half hour from 22:30 to 04:30 a ring of 5-8
##   buses (seeded by the day and the slot) gathers in two rows at the kerb of Aleje
##   Jerozolimskie in front of the station (HUB_ROWS: the shelters on both sides), each arriving
##   within ARRIVE s of the slot and standing WAIT s (2-4 min), then driving on as any bus. The
##   ring is real only while the view is near (HUB_BAND): its buses are recruited from the
##   traffic's (an out-of-sight bus is taken over) or taken from the pool, parked at their bays
##   when the bay is out of sight, or driven in from upstream when it is in sight. E23: the
##   player at the ring (HUB_NEAR) while 5 or more stand there; the `bus_stop` night line once
##   per gathering.
## - **Bus stops**: the map's shelters beside a bus road (a class 0-1 edge's kerb lane, the
##   shelter on its right: `stop_from`); the STOPS_NEAR nearest within STOP_RANGE of the view get
##   1-2 waiting figures by day (06:00-22:00; pedestrians.gd's stop slots, +0 draw calls), the
##   hub's 2-3 at night while the ring stands; a `bus_stop` bubble when the car stops beside one.
## - **Service (G8, 2026-11-01)**: the traffic's own buses serve the stops by day. A bus within
##   SERVE_RANGE of the view, on a stop's edge with the stop SERVE_AHEAD m ahead, is sent there
##   (traffic.gd `send_to_stop`: it takes the kerb lane, stands DWELL s, drives on); a stop
##   never sees the same bus again within SERVE_GAP s. While it stands at a stop that has figures
##   (a `session`), 1-3 passengers step off at the front door and walk away along the footway,
##   then 1-2 of the people waiting walk to the door and board; the stop's waiting figures come
##   back (new arrivals) BOARDED_BACK s after the bus leaves. Pedestrians.STOPS slots, +0 draw
##   calls; a plain timer state machine (arrive, dwell, depart), Beehave not used: a bus has three
##   states and there are crowds of them (docs/ADDONS.md).
## - **The horn** (`honk`: the HUD's horn and the B key): the player's own horn (sfx.gd
##   `horn_player`), the dogs bark (city_life.gd `horn`), walkers coming at the car turn round;
##   at most one honk per HORN_GAP s. Stopped at a stop, a honk calls a bus: the nearest one
##   within CALL_REACH that can drive there, or one from the pool upstream out of sight; it pulls
##   in by the car for CALL_WAIT s. E24 when it does (the `bus_stop` request line at the honk).
## - **E25, racing the night bus**: a bus leaving the hub's eastbound row while the player is at
##   the ring drives to the Palm (Rondo de Gaulle'a); the car there first, with no speed trap's
##   flash (police.gd `trap_flashes`) on the way, finds E25.
## Nothing runs per frame but a timer: one tick every TICK s.
