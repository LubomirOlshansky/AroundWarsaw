## Loop 2e: the screen in points, Apple's unit for touch targets and text (44 pt is the
## smallest comfortable tap; 3 px a point on the iPhones the game targets), and the safe area
## (the Dynamic Island or notch, the rounded corners, the home indicator) in landscape.
##
## On a phone both come from the device. On a computer the window stands in for a phone: a
## window the size of a known iPhone's screen in landscape gets that iPhone's scale and safe
## area (2868x1320 is the 6.9" Pro Max, 956 x 440 pt with 62 pt each side and 21 pt at the
## bottom), any other window is taken as a phone 390 pt tall with no insets (the 6.1" class),
## so screenshots and the HUD check show what the phone would. In landscape iOS insets both
## sides the same, whichever side the island is on, so the layout holds turned either way.
##
##   var s := ScreenPoints.measure(get_viewport().get_visible_rect().size)
##   s["pt"]    pixels per point
##   s["safe"]  the safe area in pixels (Rect2)

## Width x height in pixels (landscape) -> [pixels per point, left, right, top, bottom
## insets in points]. iPhones from the X on; the SE has no insets.
