## Gamepad loop (2026-11-01, F asked "can it work with the pad?"): Xbox, PlayStation and MFi
## controllers through Godot's joypad input (SDL's mapping on the Mac and Linux, the Game
## Controller framework on iOS: the same button indices for all three). Touch and the keys stay
## as they were; the pad is a third way in, read next to them in main.gd `_read_input`.
##
## Driving follows the scheme (drive_controls.gd), like the touch stick:
##   left stick   POINT / FIXED: point the way (pushed further = more gas); CLASSIC: steer
##   RT           gas (CLASSIC); the helicopter climbs
##   LT or B      brake / reverse; the helicopter sinks (LT)
## Buttons (one press, `command`), named after the keys they stand for:
##   A primary (M)     X secondary (K)     Y car / helicopter (H)
##   LB or RB held: the nitro (Shift), once bought   right stick flicked left / right: turn the view (Q / E)
##   R3 follow camera (C)     L3 horn (B)
##   D-pad up / down zoom in / out (= / -)  D-pad right radio (R)     D-pad left flash lights (L)
##   Back / Share / View: the full map      Start / Options / Menu: Settings (Esc)
## Menus: Godot's own ui_up..ui_right carry the D-pad and the left stick; `install` adds A to
## ui_accept and B to ui_cancel. The settings card and the full map close on B, Start and Back.
##
## Pure functions over InputEvents and an action strength table so game/tools/check_gamepad.gd
## can drive them with synthetic events (no controller in CI).
##
## Glyphs and rumble (2026-11-02, the gamepad gaps in BACKLOG): the hints name the buttons the way
## the pad in the player's hands prints them. `note` reads the pad's name (Input.get_joy_name)
## and sorts it into a family: PlayStation (× / Circle / Square / Triangle, R2 / L2, R1 / L1),
## Nintendo (the labels sit swapped: the bottom button reads B, the right one A; ZR / ZL) or Xbox,
## which also covers MFi and unknown pads (the labels the button indices are named after). Hint
## text carries tokens, `fmt("Hold {a} to jump")`, filled per family and language by `key`.
## The HUD's font (Open Sans) has × but no ○ □ △, so the other PlayStation faces are words.
## Haptics.buzz sends the buzz to the pad (Input.start_joy_vibration) instead of the phone while
## the pad is in use: the hands are on the pad, the phone may sit on a stand.
