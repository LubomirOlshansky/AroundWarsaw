## Beta values (2026-11-04), GAMEPLAY_PLAN 1.5 item 1: the lane assist, "Asysta pasa". With the
## steering near the middle the car eases towards the direction of the lane it drives in, so a long
## avenue or a gentle curve (Wisłostrada, Trasa Łazienkowska, the bridges) holds without constant
## small thumb movements on the strip. It never fights a deliberate turn: its pull fades to nothing
## as the steering moves past NEAR_CENTRE, and it lets go past MAX_ERR off the lane (a turn into
## another street, a lane change at a big angle).
##
## Classic only (the strip and the pedals; Point already aims where the finger points), behind
## Settings → Jazda → Asysta pasa (settings.gd `lane_assist`, off by default until F has felt it).
## main.gd finds the lane's direction (`lane_heading`, 10 times a second) and car.gd adds the pull
## (`yaw_pull`) to the steering. tools/check_lane_assist.gd measures it.

const LaneGraph := preload("res://scripts/lane_graph.gd")

## The pull (1/s): the yaw rate asked for per radian of heading error (GAMEPLAY_PLAN's k ≈ 1.5).
const GAIN := 1.5
## Only below this heading error to the lane (rad): past it the player is turning off.
const MAX_ERR := deg_to_rad(20.0)
## The steering share under which the assist works, fading to 0 at this share.
const NEAR_CENTRE := 0.15
## On from this speed (m/s, ~15 km/h), fully on from FULL_SPEED (~22 km/h).
const MIN_SPEED := 4.2

## The lane must be this close to the car (m): on the carriageway, not on a parallel street.
const REACH := 3.5
## How far apart the car's heading and the lane's may be to count as "driving in it" (rad).
const ALIGN := deg_to_rad(35.0)
## The aim is a point on the lane this many seconds ahead (pure pursuit), between AHEAD_MIN and
## AHEAD_MAX m: it holds the car to the lane's middle and round a curve. A pull to the lane's own
## direction alone left a steady error on a curve (1.8° at 50 km/h on 300 m: 4.3 m wide in 10 s).
const AHEAD_TIME := 0.9
const AHEAD_MIN := 8.0
const AHEAD_MAX := 30.0


## The yaw rate (rad/s, + turns left like car.gd's yaw) the assist adds: `err` the signed angle from
## the car's heading to the lane's (rad), `steer` the player's steering (-1..1), `speed` (m/s).
