## The car radio: made-up stations, each with a playlist, and Off. The stations and their
## tracks come from data/radio.json (tools/add_music.py puts songs there: README, "Adding
## music"); a station with several tracks plays them in a shuffled order, each to its end,
## and one with a single track loops it. R or the RADIO button tunes to the next station;
## a short burst of static covers the switch. Every change emits station_changed, every
## new track track_changed, and announce() puts any line (the radio host's, dialogue.gd)
## on the HUD's now-playing ticker.
##
## Loop radio-playlists: the stations moved from a const with one WAV loop each to
## radio.json with Ogg Vorbis tracks (streamed: the compressed file is decoded as it plays,
## never as a whole in memory) and playlists shuffled by the date.
##
## Loop MW-5 (docs/design/vision.md 4.6): PÓŁNOC FM, 86,0, the late-night station. On air
## 22:00-06:00 by the game clock (`clock`) and always in the Night and Dawn looks; by day it
## plays reruns at 70 % level and its host is silent (host_group). A station with "free": N in
## radio.json has locked tracks: its first N are free, the rest open one a finished notebook
## chapter, in order (sync_chapters), or by unlock_track(n) (the eggs E14 and E31 later); a
## locked track never plays. The unlocks live in the save (wallet.gd `tracks`). Until the player
## picks a station this session (`picked`), the radio follows the clock: PÓŁNOC FM on air, KEBAB
## FM otherwise. --radio-log prints the tunes, tracks, host lines, unlocks and air changes.
