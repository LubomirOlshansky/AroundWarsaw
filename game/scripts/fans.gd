## Kibice (F's idea 7, 2026-11-02; docs/design/city-life-satire.md "7 Legia fans"): friendly football
## fans outside Stadion Leguminy (landmarks.gd `legia`, ul. Łazienkowska) on match evenings. Funny,
## never harmful: scarves, a drum, a banner with a soft joke, hand-held pink "smoke" (a puff, no fire,
## no weapons), a kid with a giant foam finger and a patrol car parked by the gate whose officer only
## drinks a coffee. No crest, no club name, no real chant, nothing about other fans: colours only.
##  - **When**: `match_on`: Wednesday 17:00-21:30, Saturday 15:00-21:30, Sunday 14:00-20:30 (the
##    game clock); --fans-now has them out at any hour.
##  - **Where**: three groups (`GROUPS`) on the footways round the stadium: the north gate and the
##    north-east corner on Łazienkowska, and the south side by the bridge approach (Trasa
##    Łazienkowska). Each group stands on the pavement nearest its anchor and on the open ground
##    on whichever side of it has more room (never on a road, never inside a building), a banner
##    on two poles at the back (its words on both faces), the drummer at the side, two smoke
##    holders and the kid at the front, everyone facing away from the banner.
##  - **The chant**: every CHANT_GAP s a group sings for CHANT_LEN s: everyone jumps on the drum's
##    beat and the scarves go up over the heads; between chants they sway, scarves round the neck.
##    The player's horn within HONK_R m starts a chant at once (and a `honk` line).
##  - **Lines** (`kibice` in data/dialogue.json, `police_kibice` for Sierżant Bogdan): a chant line
##    when a chant starts on screen, chat between, `car` for a slow car by a group, `kid` now and
##    then from the kid; a toast the first time the car meets the fans.
##  - **Sound**: city_sounds.gd's `chant` kind (the fan_chant loop, tools/make_sfx.py) at each group
##    while it is out.
##  - **Match day** (follow-up, 2026-11-02): kick-off is KICK_AFTER h into the evening (`phase_at`).
##    In the ARRIVE h before it fans walk (`ROUTES`) from the bus stops by the Trasa Łazienkowska
##    and along Łazienkowska and Czerniakowska to the groups, more as kick-off nears, the last few
##    running late; from FULL_TIME h after kick-off, for LEAVE h, they stream back the other way.
##    The result is a win or a draw (never a loss: the joke is warm), rolled at full time: a win
##    has the groups sing twice as often, scarves up on the way home and `win` lines; a draw has
##    "następnym razem" (`draw`). The routes are found once on the footways and zebras (AStar2D).
## Drawing: the fans one MultiMesh (the pedestrians' person mesh), their props one (a four-shape
## family: a scarf held up, a scarf round the neck, the officer's coffee, the foam finger), the smoke
## puffs one, and the three groups' banners, drums and smoke sticks one mesh, the walkers one more
## (the person mesh with the walking legs; their scarves join the props): +5 draw calls while the
## view is within ACTIVE_R of the stadium on a match evening (+4 when nobody walks), nothing otherwise. No sun shadow, no
## collision (like the coffee raves). The logic ticks at 2 Hz, the figures move at 10 Hz while near.
## The rules are static functions (check_fans.gd runs them on synthetic clocks and the real map).
