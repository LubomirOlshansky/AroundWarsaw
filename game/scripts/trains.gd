## Trains on the city's railway (T1 of docs/design/railway.md): suburban units, the city line and
## long-distance trains on the baked rail tracks (OpenStreetMap `rails`, drawn by map_builder as
## ballast and rails). The tracks have no direction, so every piece is used both ways; pieces
## join where their ends meet and the line runs on smoothly. A train comes in where the railway
## enters the map (its edge, or one of the cross-city tunnel's mouths: the tunnel itself is not in
## the map), runs through at city speed, stops at the platforms it serves (Ochota, Powiśle,
## Stadion; the long-distance trains run through), and slides out under the next edge or into the
## next tunnel mouth; a while later another comes in somewhere. Only one train holds a stretch of
## track at a time, so trains never meet head on. Each car is an AnimatableBody3D (the player's car
## bounces off them, as off the trams); cars far from the view are hidden.
