## PT bug log (docs/PLAYTEST.md): the spots where a playtest found the car stopping dead, driven
## again by the real car script (car.gd) in the real city (the sectors round the spots, built from
## their files, or the prebuilt sector scenes with --prebuilt), gas held, no steering, no traffic.
## Each spot is a start, a heading and a speed; the car fails it if it sits under STALL m/s for
## more than STALL_TIME s, needs an unstick, or ends under its share of the start speed.
##
## PT-1 (2026-11-02): at 24-30 m/s the car stopped dead on Marszałkowska's west kerb line north of
## the start. It had driven inside Centrum's 0.9 m tram platform (not solid, so the car rode in the
## slab) and hit the shelter on it end on; brushing the fence along the kerb cost 1.2/s of its whole
## speed. Fixed: platforms that high are solid at their edges away from roads (map_builder.gd
## SOLID_PLATFORM, PLATFORM_ROAD_CLEAR) and
## the scrape scales with how hard the car presses in (car.gd SCRAPE_PRESS).
##
## PT-4 (2026-11-02): hard stops on Marszałkowska by Rondo Dmowskiego, among the underpass stairs;
## after the roundabout's rebuild (site `rondo`) the lanes up to the ring drive clean.
##
## PT-2 and PT-5 (2026-11-02): suspects from the Autopilot runs (a block NE of Plac Defilad, the side
## streets west of Marszałkowska). Not reproduced: ~680 straight lines (every 40 m, both ways, both
## areas, 12 m/s with the gas held) along the real road centrelines stop only at dead ends and
## road ends, and kerb-hugging lines stop only at the walls and houses past the kerb. The agent's
## stops there were off-route wandering into courtyards and gated service roads. Six lines
## along the main streets stay as guards.
##
## (Head on into the platform's 3 m end the car stops, as at any wall, and is turned out.)
##
## PT-7 (2026-11-02): by the curved glass corner of Chmielna and Bracka (Zgoda's end) a car held
## towards Krucza, sliding along the block's front, caught its front corner in a 3 m notch where two
## buildings meet (-630,186) and in the 0.5 m slit and 0.3 m step between the glass building and
## Jabłkowski's (-596,190): pinned, turned out, pinned again, towed. The playtest's camera ghosted
## the building, so the frames showed no wall. Fixed: low collider walls across slits and small
## notches and a taper in front of small steps (map_builder.gd `_bridge_pockets`). These spots
## steer like the point-to-steer stick held one way (an 8th field: the compass heading held).
##
## PT-17 (2026-11-03): following the KASETA arrow by car at Plac Dąbrowskiego, the playtest car went
## back and forth on Jasna's east pavement for 70 s until the tow. Jasna's facade there (by the
## square's corner) has a 24 m bay 2.3 m deep between two rounded piers 2 m proud: a car whose
## stick points into the block slid along the bay into one pier, was turned out along the wall into
## the other, and so on. Fixed: bays up to 30 m wide and 2.5 m deep get a wall across the mouth too
## (map_builder.gd BAY_MOUTH, BAY_DEPTH). 4 spots slide along it both ways (all 4 fail on the old map).
##
## PT-18 (2026-11-03): under the Trasa Łazienkowska, Solec's ramp up to the Trasa (deck group 7)
## crosses Solec 5 m up. On the ramp, where it turns west over Solec, the mapped guard rail comes
## in pieces 0.9 m apart with the parapet 0.5 m behind: a car sliding along it put its front corner
## in a gap and caught the next piece's end, pinned at (1307, 959) (the playtest's 1.6 s stop at
## (1308, 960)). Under the ramp, its pier stood 2 m off Solec's west kerb: a car on the kerb lane
## drifting 5° west hit it head on. Fixed: guard rail gaps under 1.5 m on a deck get a shallow V behind the rail line (lanes cut through stay clear)
## (map_builder.gd GUARD_JOIN), and piers keep 2 m more room beside a main road wherever their
## slide finds it (tools/bake_structures.py PIER_ROADSIDE; 44 of 359 piers moved 1-2 m). All but
## the last spot fail on the old map; a car that leaves Solec 3 m or more onto the verge can still
## meet the pier, as at any pier.
##
## Prints one line per spot and `check_stuck_spots: OK`, or the failures and exit 1. ~10 s on the Mac.
