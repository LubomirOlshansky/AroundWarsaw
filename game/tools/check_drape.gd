## Loop 3b-2: what the ground hides, and what an area hides, over the whole map, from the
## builder's own meshes.
##
## 1. The bare ground poking through the flat areas laid on it (the water, the grass and parks,
##    plazas, sand). The ground is the terrain grid's two triangles per 10 m cell
##    (map_builder._build_ground); an area drawn in pieces whose planes don't follow the grid's
##    folds dips under the ground there, and the ground shows through as jagged beige patches
##    (the river's "torn paper sandbars", lumps in the parks). Each area triangle is sampled at
##    four points (its centroid and half way from it to each corner, a quarter of its area
##    each); a sample more than POKE m under the ground counts.
## 2. A thin strip laid over an area (footways and paving, cycle paths, steps, the natural banks'
##    wet bands and foam, the sandbars' rims) hidden by it: a strip piece is a plane through
##    terrain points that sags over the grid's folds, and where it sags further than its depth
##    bias and height lift it over the area under it, the area covers it (the Praga beach's
##    footpath came out in dashes when the beach became sand). With the camera's 30° pitch a
##    point's depth towards the camera is height * PITCH_SIN + its bias; a strip sample counts
##    when an area triangle under it (the same x, z) is as near the camera or nearer.
##
## Prints the area per kind and `check_drape: OK` when every kind has under ALLOWED m2 (strips:
## ALLOWED_STRIPS); else exit 1. ~12 s (6 s of it building the city).
##   godot --headless --path game --script res://tools/check_drape.gd [-- --verbose]
## --verbose lists the 20 worst places (x, z, kind, how far).
