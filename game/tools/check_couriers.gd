## Loop couriers (docs/design/parodies.md 4.2): the Pędzik couriers waiting at the kebab stands at
## night, the riders on the road's kerb edge and their dodge (scripts/city_life.gd), headless, from
## the committed map data (map/centrum.json: the lane graph, the paths, the kebab pois placed as
## jobs.gd places them) and data/places.json; seeded, no clock of its own (every hour is synthetic):
##   1. the rules: the kerb riders' counts (3 by day, 5 at night, × the amount), 1 or 2 couriers
##      waiting by each stand at night and none by day (the same night always the same), the roads
##      a kerb rider takes;
##   2. the dodge on synthetic inputs: the closest approach over the next second, a swerve within
##      4 m where there is room, a hop where there is none, nothing for a car passing wide, going
##      away or still far; the hop's 0.3 s arc;
##   3. the near miss's line: at most one in 30 s (10 in 300 s of near misses every 2 s at 30 km/h,
##      none under 10 km/h), through the real function;
##   4. the real city at night by a stand: its couriers (as many as its rule and free spots give, by
##      the kiosk, off the lanes), drawn after the riders in the Pedzik MultiMesh with the standing
##      shape; one taken by the race is gone until the stand leaves the band; none by day;
##   5. the kerb riders on the real lane graph: as many as the rule in the band round the view, on
##      their roads' kerb line (the outer lane's kerb, KERB_IN in), still riding kerb roads after 20 s;
##   6. a car driven at a kerb rider along his line: he swerves (or hops), never inside the car's
##      footprint, and says one line; the step's cost.
## Prints "check_couriers: OK (...)" or the problems (exit 1).
