"""Check the baked map data and the prebuilt city without opening Godot.

    python3 -I tools/check_map_data.py [--trees3d=N] [--pois=N] [--fresh]

Checks game/map/centrum.json against the counts the last full bake produced (a re-bake
that changes them must say so and update EXPECTED below in the same change), that the
lane graph and the Palm are present. Loop 3c: the same counts over the sectors
(tools/bake_sectors.py: index.json and sectors/<i>_<j>.json; a point thing near a border is in
both sectors' files, so each sector counts the ones standing in its own square), every
sector's file and prebuilt scene there.

Loop 3d-1: the split and the prebuilt sectors (index.json, sectors/*, index.res, proxies.scn,
shared/) are derived and not committed: when they are missing this says "missing: run
tools/setup_map.sh" (a WARN, not a FAIL). Freshness is by content: bake_sectors.py writes
sectors/split.stamp (the SHA-256 of what it read) and bake_city.gd writes sectors/city.stamp
(the split's digest and the SHA-256 of the maps and scripts it builds from); a stamp that
doesn't match today's files is a WARN (stale: re-run, see docs/DEVELOPMENT.md "Sectors and streaming").

--fresh: only the derived files, quietly: exit 0 when the split and the prebuilt sectors are
there and match their inputs, 3 when either is missing or stale (tools/setup_map.sh
--if-needed and tools/verify.sh use it).

Prints one line per check: OK / WARN / FAIL. Exits 1 if any check fails.
Reads only; writes nothing.
