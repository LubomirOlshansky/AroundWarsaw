"""Loop 3b: the city builder's structures, placed in the bake (docs/DEMO.md 4.4: R5, R6, R7 and
the buildings under decks) so that the game, tools/check_roads.py and game/tools/check_drive.gd
all read the same data.

Usage: imported by tools/bake_osm.py (`add_structures(out, map_dir)` on the finished map file,
before it is written). Standalone, on a baked map: python3 -I tools/bake_structures.py [MAP_DIR]
prints what it would place (nothing is written).

What it adds to the map file:
- `decks.piers` (R5): the boxes under the decks. A pier candidate stands every PIER_STEP metres
  along a road or rail deck where the deck clears the ground by PIER_MIN_AIR; it slides up to
  PIER_SLIDE metres along the deck to the nearest spot where its footprint is PIER_PAD clear of
  every road (half its width), tram and rail bed, kerb, carriageway area and lower deck under
  it (and of every lane's drive corridor); where none is, two legs outside what runs under
  carry the deck (a portal frame, its cross-head the slab, a cap beam out to a leg that stands
  past the deck's edge), and where that fails too the pier is left out. The game draws them
  and makes them solid.
- `towers` (R7): Most Poniatowskiego's four towers seated (`place_towers`).
- `cut`, `cutd`, `pil` on buildings and `lod2_cuts` (C9): buildings under decks (`place_cuts`).
- `walls` (R6): retaining walls along the approaches, the tunnels and their open ramps
  (`place_walls`, `place_tunnels`); `tunnels.frames` (the portals) and `garage_doors`.
- `lines` and the solid props cleared out of the carriageways and lanes (`clear_carriageways`);
  fills widened to hold their lanes (`widen_fills`), road decks narrowed beside a ground lane
  (`narrow_decks`), LoD2 walls in a lane not solid
  (`lod2_open`), and `aprons` where a structure's end meets the ground (`place_aprons`).
- Map review A (2026-10-29): street furniture standing on a tram track left out
  (`clear_carriageways`), and `trees3d_crown` shrunk for scanned crowns through a deck's edge
  (`trim_crowns`).
