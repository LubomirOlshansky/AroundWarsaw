"""Smooth roads (F, 2026-11-05: "make the roads smooth, like it was hand designed"): the width
steps where two OpenStreetMap ways of one carriageway meet, tapered; the lane lines stitched
across those joins; small kinks in the lines rounded.

    python3 -I tools/road_smooth.py [MAP.json] [--dry] [--report]
        rewrites the map in place (idempotent: a map already smoothed is left alone);
        --dry measures and changes nothing; --report prints the steps and jogs left.
    python3 -I tools/road_smooth.py --check [MAP.json]
        exit 1 unless the map is smoothed and its edge steps and line jogs are at most
        CHECK_STEPS and CHECK_JOGS (verify.sh step `smooth`; a ratchet: lower them, never raise).

Why. The bake draws every OpenStreetMap way as its own ribbon (`roads[].w` wide, `c` off its
centreline) and paints its lane lines on its own (bake_roads.bake_lane_lines). Where the lane
count or the width changes at a join, the ribbon edge jumps sideways, the wider way's round end
cap bulges past the narrower one (the dark blob by the kerb), the kerb and the edge line, walked
round that outline, jog with it, and every lane line ends and starts again up to 1.6 m aside.
852 joins of the demo box stepped their edge by more than 0.3 m (588 by more than 1 m). A real
street opens or closes a lane with a taper: the edge drifts over 20-30 m, the lines with it.

What, on the finished map data (bake_osm.py calls `apply(out)` after car_free and the other
post-passes; this file also runs on a baked map, as the cloud has no OpenStreetMap download):

1. Chains: two drivable ways (not service or living streets) meet end to end at one point,
   carry on within CHAIN_COS, on the same deck level, with the same name and one-way flag.
2. Taper: at every join whose edge steps by STEP_MIN..STEP_MAX m, both ways get per-vertex
   widths and centre offsets (`wv`, `cv`, one per point of `p`; vertices are added every
   TAPER_STEP m on the taper without moving the line, so `hide` distances stay true). On each
   side the wider way keeps its edge to the node and the narrower one flares out to it along one
   smoothstep over L = TAPER_BASE + TAPER_PER_M * step (TAPER_MIN..TAPER_MAX m, at most half
   the way): where the wider way's round end cap bulged, a lane now opens or closes. The kerbs
   and lines of the wider way stay true. map_builder.gd draws `wv`/`cv` roads as one mitred
   band, so both ends are as wide at the node and no cap bulges.
3. Kerbs and edge lines: their points by a tapered join that lie on the old stepped edge (or the
   wider way's round cap, between the two edges) are moved onto the tapered edge, keeping their
   inset (resampled every metre first); not on a side where another road leaves the node (the
   kerb turns into it there). No flare on such a side either: the wider way's corner meets the
   other road's mouth there (a flare showed as a dark flag over a driveway, F's crop by PKiN).
   Where a side's kerb runs smoothly past the taper (left alone above), the asphalt edge follows
   that kerb instead of its smoothstep (fit_kerbs), so no wedge of road pokes past the kerb.
4. Lines: a lane, centre, edge or cycle line that ends where another of its kind starts within
   STITCH_GAP m ahead, at most STITCH_SIDE m aside and parallel, is joined to it with the same
   kind of S-curve (one polyline, no gap, no jump).
5. Kinks: a lane, centre or cycle line's corner turning ROUND_MIN..ROUND_MAX degrees is rounded
   into a short arc (cut at most ROUND_CUT m each side); ribbons keep their round joins.
6. Tram beds (F's ChatGPT target): a tram track's runs on its own bed (ballast surface or tram
   median) are marked (`trams[].bed`) for sleepers; a road, footway or a zebra's line that crosses
   a bed becomes a band over it (`tram_xings`) and the kerbs and lines inside it go; steps that
   end at a metro entrance name their deep end (`steps[].down`).

The lane graph, the carriageway areas, the junction boxes and the decks are not touched.
Deterministic, standard library only. Re-run tools/bake_sectors.py and bake_city.gd after it.
