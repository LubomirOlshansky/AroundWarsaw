"""Guessed heights for small OpenStreetMap buildings (F, 2026-11-07: "revise all the thin blocks
across the map, categorise what they are, rework or remove").

    python3 -I tools/building_heights.py [MAP.json] [--dry] [--list]
        rewrites the map in place (idempotent: a building already guessed is left alone);
        --dry counts and changes nothing; --list prints every thin stand-alone block left
        (index, centre x z, height, footprint, kind) with its category.
    python3 -I tools/building_heights.py --check [MAP.json]
        exit 1 if a small building still stands at the old 14 m guess (verify.sh step `heights`).

Why. bake_osm.make_building gave every building with neither `height` nor `building:levels` a
flat 14 m, a four-storey block. On a tenement that is a fair guess; on a 12 m² metro lift
housing, a kiosk, a garden shed or a tram stop's ticket booth it stood up as a thin windowed
tower (F's crop: two at Ratusz-Arsenał, by the tram stop on Solidarności, OSM `building=service`
lift housings of 12 m², x -1517 z -1162). 929 buildings had the guess; 448 of them under 40 m².
LoD2 (GUGiK) replaces most big ones, not these: no LoD2 footprint there, so they stay OSM.

What. `default_height(kind, area)` is the guess for a building with no height tags: by its kind
first (KIND_HEIGHTS: kiosks, sheds, garages, lift housings, booths, boats ...) while it is under
KIND_AREA m², then by its footprint (under 40 m² one storey, under 100 m² two), else 14 m as
before. bake_osm.make_building calls it, and this file applies the same rule to a baked map
(the cloud has no OpenStreetMap download): a building at exactly 14.0 m (the old guess) with a
footprint under 150 m² gets the new guess. Tagged heights are kept, even thin ones (pillars under
a raised floor, chimneys, a tagged 10 m industrial shed): they are real.
