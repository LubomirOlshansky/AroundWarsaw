"""Generate the game's sound effects and ambience (original, synthesised from scratch).

Usage: python3 -I tools/make_sfx.py game/audio/sfx [game/audio/radio] [--only=name,...]

No samples, no downloads: every sound is built here from oscillators, noise and
filters, in the same pure-Python way as make_music.py and make_ui_sounds.py.

Loops are made seamless the way the radio loops are: the excitation is periodic by
construction (pulses at whole-sample periods, noise generated once per loop length)
and every filter runs over the loop three times, keeping the last pass, so its state
at the end matches the start. Writes 16-bit 22.05 kHz WAVs: mono, except the city and
rain beds (stereo: they are wide and nothing sits in the middle). In Godot, import the
loops with loop mode Forward, loop end = the full length, QOA (tools/check_sfx.gd).

After writing, it prints a table per file: peak and RMS (dBFS), for loops the step
and the slope across the loop point against the 99.9th percentile elsewhere, the
share of energy below 2 kHz and the 85% roll-off frequency; and the radio loops'
levels (if their folder is given) to balance the buses against.

  engine_idle / engine_mid / engine_high   a tired 1.2 l four-cylinder hatchback at

  bark_small / bark_mid / bark_big   loop MW-4 (city_life.gd): a dog's bark at a horn, three
      sizes (a long low dog, a squat flat-faced one, a big fluffy one): a glottal pulse train

  bike_bell      a bicycle's thumb bell: two strikes of a small bell, 0.6 s
  watch_beep     a running watch's double beep at 2.4 kHz as Kolka passes
  queue_chatter  a trend queue's chatter: six voices, closer and brighter than the murmur (a 6 s
      loop)

  cafe_bell      a café door's bell: three little tings, 0.9 s
  frog_chime     loop MW-2: the Frogs shop's door, a two-note croak "kum-kum" and a ting, 0.8 s
