description: Takes Nocna Warszawa screenshots at real phone sizes with tools/shots.sh (spawn, Marszałkowska, the Palace, the river, Rondo Dmowskiego, helicopter, settings; day, night, rain; runtime and prebuilt city) and judges them against the art bible for readability, consistency and defects. Use after any visible change, for before/after pairs, when reviewing 2D art in the game, and when asked "how does it look?" or "what looks worst?".

# Screenshots at phone size, and how to judge them

## Take them

```zsh
tools/shots.sh $ARGUMENTS                       # core set, 2532x1170, into shots/review_<time>/
tools/shots.sh --set=quick --tag=before         # spawn by day (runtime) + night (prebuilt)
tools/shots.sh --size=2868x1320 --set=spawn_day # the user's 6.9" Pro Max
tools/shots.sh --set=river_night -- --quality=low --style=2   # extra game flags for every shot
tools/shots.sh --list                           # the named shots
```

Each shot opens a window for ~10-30 s (it needs a renderer), runs with `--nosave --free`, and
quits by itself. Shots go to `shots/` (gitignored); give files a loop prefix when they are
evidence for a report (`shots/loop3_*.png`). For a spot not in the list:
`cd game && godot --path . --resolution 2532x1170 --fixed-fps 60 -- --nosave --free --at=X,Z
--heading=DEG --shots=240 --out=$PWD/../shots/NAME` (README lists every flag: `--size=`
view height in metres, `--yaw=`, `--lift=`, `--nohud`, `--tap=X,Y`, `--settings`, ...).

- Before/after: same spot, same flags, same size; render the "before" from a copy of the old
  code if the change is already in (`cp -cR game game_before` on APFS; `game_*/` is gitignored;
  delete it afterwards).
- Both city paths: anything the map builder makes needs a `--prebuilt` shot too.
- Night, dusk and rain are separate looks (`--time=`, `--weather=rain`): check the one you touched.
- Phone sizes: 2532x1170 (6.1" iPhone 12-15), 2868x1320 (6.9" Pro Max). Loop 2e: a window the
  size of a known iPhone gets that phone's points and safe area (`game/scripts/screen_points.gd`;
  2868x1320 is 956x440 pt), any other window is taken as a phone 390 pt tall, so these shots
  show real HUD sizes. `game/tools/check_hud.gd` measures them (44 pt, 11 pt, overlaps).

## Look at them (open every PNG with Read; never judge a shot you didn't look at)

Judge against `art-bible.md` (next to this file; read it first). In order:

1. **Defects**: z-fighting, floating or sunken objects, cars or trams inside buildings or
   bridges, holes in decks, stray lines, wrong-path lighting, text clipped or overlapping,
   a black or flat area where a texture should be.
2. **Readability at the default view** (80 m, the car ~58 px long on 1170 lines): can you tell
   the car, the road, where to go, what is tappable? Is any HUD text under ~11 pt or any
   touch target under 44 pt?
3. **Consistency**: does a new thing share the city's palette, outlines, pixel scale and
   light? Does night read as night (dark, calm, lit by its lamps and neon)?
4. **Warsaw**: would someone from Warsaw recognise the place in the shot?

Measure when you can instead of guessing: crop and compare mean luma of a region against a
reference ring (loop 1 did this for the occlusion ghost), count pixels, compare before/after
with a pixel diff.

## Report

For each shot: path, what it shows, verdict (good / fix / blocker) with the specific thing
and where on the image ("upper left, the deck's parapet stops 3 m short of the tower"). Then
a ranked list "what looks worst", each with the likely cause if you know it, and the shots
you still need (exact `tools/shots.sh` commands).
